This methodology is appropriate for any type of place-based  planningincluding hazard mitigation. However, the Workbook was designed with environmental professionals who manage  watersheds or coastal places and protect the health of aquatic  ecosystems as its main audience. This Workbook assumes that  users:   represent an organization that has environmental goals or  objectives;  start with some sense that climate change will pose a threat  to what their organization is trying to accomplish;  are comfortable using science to inform decision-making; and  have sufficient knowledge of their environmental system (or can partner with those who do) to  understand how climate changes may affect the way it functions.", "54": "Risk Management A risk management process helps with decision-making when organizations are faced with uncertainty  about whether they will be able to meet their goals. Risk management guides an organization to help  it determine what risks are important and need to be addressed. The process encourages a broad  look at all potential risks to an organizations goals. The process is systematic and builds on information  generated in previous steps, allows for judgments and decisions, and allows users to incorporate new  data and information as they become available.  Begin sidebar elaboration defining how the word organization is used in this workbook.  Organization ISO 31000 can be used by any  public, private or community  enterprise, association, group or  individual (p. 1). The Workbook,  like the standard it is based on,  uses the term organization to  refer to any user. End of Sidebar 2  FEMAs Mitigation Planning How-To Guide # 1 (FEMA 386-1), Introduction Table 1, describes a very similar process for hazard  mitigation planning.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 7 Introduction and How to Use This Workbook Risk management is a flexible process. How it is  implemented depends on the organization and  the purpose for which it is used. Sometimes, when  people initially hear that they will be participating  in a risk management process, they misperceive  what that will mean. Risk management can be a  lengthy, demanding process. It often entails  laboratory analysis, extensive use of statistical  analysis, and other difficult, costly or time- consuming steps. However, when there is no  direct, imminent threat to health or safety or a  planning-level assessment is acceptable, then less  intensive approaches to risk management can be  appropriate. The identified risk management  framework can be used for chemical exposure,  engineering decisions or global climate change,  but how each step is executed or what types of  conclusions can be reached may be different.  Risk management is about your organization: your  goals and objectives, your context, your priorities,  your decisions on how to respond. Systematically  working through your situation with a risk  management framework will help you:  find risks that you might have overlooked  and avoid surprises;  assess risks differently than you otherwise  would have;  find strategies that can address more than one risk and increase efficiency;  make better decisions; and  increase the odds that you will be able to reach your goals. You will also have a reference to why you think something is important and needs attention as well as a  communication tool that allows others to understand system challenges. The ISO 31000Risk Management methodology is the  foundation of this Workbook. Here, the start-to-finish procedure  described in the standard is divided into two halves to be  consistent with the community of practice for climate change  adaptation (Figure I-1). Part 1 is referred to as a vulnerability  assessment (which in the Workbooks methodology can be a  stand-alone product); Part 2 is an action plan. Part 2 also includes  implementation of the action plan", "55": "Vulnerability Assessments A vulnerability assessment is an understanding of how climate change will uniquely affect your  organization. The organization is the center of attention, and the reasons why it exists (i.e., its purpose,  mission, goals or objectives) are the base units of the vulnerability assessment.  Organizational goals are the focus of concern. Goals are why organizations exist and what motivates  them; goals provide a context for changes. The vulnerability assessment half of a risk-based adaptation  plan is different from a climate change impacts study that describes how the future will be different if  the climate is different. An impact that is identified without reference to a goal is just a detail. There is no  context to say it is good or bad or that something should be done about it or not. Context comes from  people or organizations. They can say that an impact will help, hurt or have no effect on what they are  trying to do (Table I-1). If impacts will be unwanted, goals might still be attainable if risk-reducing actions  can be implemented. ", "56": "The Workbook has five steps that lead to a climate change vulnerability assessment:  Step 1Communication and Consultation Informing key people about the vulnerability assessment and asking for input.  Step 2Establishing the Context for the Vulnerability Assessment Identifying organizational goals that are susceptible to climate change.  Step 3Risk Identification Brainstorming about how climate stressors will interact with your goals.  Step 4Risk Analysis Developing an initial characterization of consequence and likelihood for each risk.  Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks  Using a consequence/probability matrix to build consensus about each risk.", "57": "The Workbook has five steps that lead to a climate change vulnerability assessment:  Step 1Communication and Consultation Informing key people about the vulnerability assessment and asking for input.

Step 4Risk Analysis Developing an initial characterization of consequence and likelihood for each risk.  Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks  Using a consequence/probability matrix to build consensus about each risk. A vulnerability assessment represents a step forward, not an end in itself. However, the Workbook treats  a vulnerability assessment as a potential stand-alone product. A vulnerability assessment is a precursor  to an action plan, but it will have value on its own for communication, coordination and decision support.  A vulnerability assessment is a product to be used with your board of directors, senior management, and  peer organizations, and with other levels of government. It is helpful for working with others to obtain  funding, resources, buy-in or approval. Additionally, a broad look at all potential problems allows others  to scan across places, compare neighboring systems, and find partners for addressing common risks.  A vulnerability assessment is also a tool that will help you answer a series of questions about risks and  mitigating options that you will need to ask when preparing your action plan. While it is not necessary to have a stand-alone vulnerability assessment, there can be benefits to pausing  after the assessment becomes available. Time to let the vulnerability assessment findings sink in may be  useful. Pausing also provides an opportunity for consensus building before an action plan is developed.  It is also a time to speak to potential partners about collaborating or dividing up tasks. A response that  will effectively mitigate some risks to tolerable levels could be very expensive or politically sensitive.  Securing resources that can be applied to climate change problems can also take time. Further, some  risks might not start to cause problems for several more decades. For these reasons completing a  vulnerability assessment could mark a temporary break in the adaptation process.  This is a risk management process for climate change. Taking a few days, weeks or months before  launching into the action planning process could be useful. However, if there is no strategy to use an  interim period or if the benefits of pausing are small, keep going with the action planning steps.", "58": "Action Plans An action plan is a document that explains how you will manage your climate change risks. After  completing a vulnerability assessment, you will have identified the risks that have the highest potential to  affect your organizations ability to meet its goals.  The vulnerability assessment process helped you decide which risks to focus on. Now you will identify  actions that might help to decrease those risks and increase the sustainability of your system. Making  these decisions when you have limited resources and probably cannot mitigate all of your risks will not  be easy. Pursuing win-win solutions or no-regrets actions will be appealing options that make sense  regardless of what the future brings.

Involving others will pay off in many ways as you develop your adaptation plan. You will learn what  topics potential partners are concerned about, who can contribute expertise, and whether you have  support for moving forward. The process described in this Workbook is well suited for a collaborative  approach where key stakeholders can participate and work toward consensus. There is no one best way  for communicating with stakeholders, and different methods will be appropriate in different steps of the  Workbook. Workbook steps have lists of resources that can help with external communications. Appendix  B also has cross-references to other guides that may be helpful.  Partnering with another organization in your area that has similar interests in assessing climate change  can be a great opportunity. When you go through your communication and consultation process (Step  1), you should ask if your stakeholders want to join together to assess climate change effects. If you decide to partner with another organization on a vulnerability assessment, Step 2Establishing  the Context for the Vulnerability Assessment provides an opportunity to identify common goals you  will jointly consider. If the other organization is already a key partner, it is likely that there is significant  overlapping interest and a common context can be established for this assessment.  During Step 3Risk Identification and Step 4Risk Analysis, working together to identify and  assess risks can save resources or time, and lead to a common outcome. There can be great benefits  to collaborating, and you certainly should when it makes sense. Partners might assess the same risk  differently simply because their organizations have different purposes. Always remember to keep your  organizations needs in mind.  In Step 6Establishing the Context for the Action Plan and Step 7Risk Evaluation: Deciding on  a Course, partnering opportunities are an important part of the process. Identifying who has mutual  interests and who can take the lead in mitigating particular risks will be a great way to accomplish more  than any organization can do by itself. In Step 9Preparing and Implementing an Action Plan and Step 10Monitoring and Review, let  your partners know how you are doing. You will want to hear about their progress too.", "61": "Process You should reach out to others who are interested  in what you are doing or who can help with your  adaptation planning. Communicate the purpose  of this work to decision-makers within your  organization and to key stakeholders. Everyone  should understand what you are trying to  accomplish and the expected outcomes.  Be able to describe what happens in each of the  steps before reaching out. What you tell and ask  other people will be much more useful if you  know how the rest of the process will unfold.  Some may be involved throughout the entire  process, while others may have a particular  interest in a single step or area of focus. However,  when Step 5 is completed, key people should  not be surprised to learn that you have a climate  change vulnerability assessment and that you  will be using that assessment to determine what  further actions are necessary.  Reaching out Every organization has a unique group of  stakeholders. Local governments, nonprofits,  federal agencies or watershed groups all have  different structures and different parties that  pay attention to what they do. Who is involved  in climate change adaptation planning is an  organizational decision. Leading candidates  would include:   anyone who would be part of  organizational strategic planning;  anyone who would help decide an annual work plan;  anyone who could help with the vulnerability assessment; and  anyone who might be able to help with implementing adaptation actions. Including the public in your planning can be helpful. The Additional Resources section in this step has  many resources about how the community can help, as well as strategies for engaging with them. Communication and consultation should occur throughout your planning, not just when it starts  and ends. Actively review the information developed here in this step and listed in Table 1-1 before  each subsequent step and update it throughout the process to track and guide communication and  consultation efforts.", "62": "Reaching out Every organization has a unique group of  stakeholders.

However, it will be possible to explain what you will be doing, how conclusions will be  reached, and what could be the next steps. Along with the organizational goals and objectives you are  considering for this assessment, key messages should include the following:   This vulnerability assessment is being launched because there is reason to believe that climate  change impacts will affect what your organization is trying to accomplish.  The purpose of the vulnerability assessment is to understand the risks that may occur, the  likelihood of occurrence for each risk, and the consequence if a risk should occur.  Risk management is part of decision-making. If climate changes are going to affect your  organizations ability to reach its goals, then you need to know what the impacts might be in  order to continue being effective.  Different perspectives on risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation are important, and  participation is welcome.  The outcome of the vulnerability assessment is an understanding of likely climate change risks;  any adaptation actions will be determined after that. Key questions for your consultations with stakeholders By nature, your stakeholders are invested and concerned with what you are doing. They can be a great  help as you develop and ultimately implement your adaptation plan. Let them know how you plan to use  their input. Your communication and consultation should strive to find answers to key questions about  how stakeholders can improve your vulnerability assessment or action plan:  Do they have resources, reports or data that they can contribute?  Do they know of any climate change work on stressors or impacts that exists or is ongoing?   Do they want to actively participate in the process or simply be informed of progress or updates?   Can they help with risk identification or risk analysis?  When it is time to decide on adaptation actions, would they be able to help implement actions to  reduce risks?   Do they have any no-gos that you should know about? Are there any topics that they are not  willing to discuss or consider?", "64": "oals are the fundamental elements Goals are the natural unit for seeing what problems climate  change may present and therefore they have important  roles in the vulnerability assessment. Goals describe what your organization intends to achieve,  and are therefore perfect for defining the scope of your  vulnerability assessment. Your vulnerability assessment  should include everything that affects your goals, while  omitting everything that has no effect on them. A useful  Sidebar elaboration defining strategic goals.  Goals Strategic goals should reflect the  broad, long-term, outcomes the agency  aspires to achieve by implementing its  mission. Strategic goals communicate  the agency efforts to address national  problems, needs, challenges, and  opportunities on behalf of the American  people. Both the way strategic goals  are framed and the substance they  communicate are important to consider.  Strategic goals should reflect the  statutory mission of the agency, and  most agency activity will align to the  strategic goals. Strategic goals need not  be as specific as strategic objectives,  however, and need not reflect every  activity that the agency must undertake  to accomplish its mission. OMB. 2013. Circular No. A11 (2013), Section  230Agency Strategic Planning. End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 21 Step 2 test that keeps your task from getting ever larger is to ask whether you would allocate resources for  efforts that have no effect on your goals. Your assessment should focus on the things your organization  cares about. You have already articulated your priorities when setting your goals. In addition, if there is no goal to test against climate stressors, then there will be no risks. The plain detail  that a stressor would cause something to occur in a place does not have meaning within itself. Once it  could affect a goal, an impact takes on a consequence. For example: you might identify that it could rain  tomorrowbut that would be just an incident; for many people that information would have no value.  However if you say it could rain tomorrow and we might not be able to have the picnic we planned, then  you introduce a consequence and you have a risk. A goal is the necessary piece for naming risks. There  will be climate change impacts all over your region but risks can only emerge if you cross climate change  stressors with your goals. Your organization may have goals that would be affected by climate change (e.g., controlling water  pollution or maintaining habitat) but may have others (e.g., recycling waste) that would not be affected  much at all. You will have to decide which of your organizations goals will be considered in this  vulnerability assessment. For a planning-level study like this, you should move forward with all of those  that could be affected by climate change.", "65": "Climate change stressors The Workbook uses seven types of climate change stressors to organize thinking:  Warmer summers (overall climate) This stressor is generally about the warm season being even warmer. This stressor (like warmer  winters, below) is about the general climate. Air, surface, soil and groundwater temperatures will  be warmer. The general climate effects of having warmer oceans or lakes are included here.  Warmer winters (overall climate) This stressor is about a cold season not being as cold as it formerly was.  Warmer water This stressor (regardless of season) comes from a higher temperature of water bodies (including  the ocean) and affects the chemical, physical or biological characteristics of the water body itself.  Increasing drought Drought is a deficiency in precipitation over an extended period. The magnitude of the  deficiency, the duration or the number of droughts could be greater.  Increasing storminess This category encompasses all aspects of intensifying precipitation in any form: more seasonal  precipitation, more total precipitation during events, higher rates of precipitation during events.  Stronger or more frequent instances of extratropical and tropical cyclones, blizzards or other  weather conditions are included here. If they are acting as stressors, then floods, waves, coastal  storm surge and wind are part of this storminess category.  Sea level rise This stressor is about the ocean being higher than it formerly was. It includes effects of higher  water levels right at the shore, as well as how elevated coastal water levels affect inland systems.  Ocean acidification  For the Workbook, this category is primarily conceptualized as related to ocean acidification via  atmospheric inputs of carbon dioxide", "66": "Risk paths Recall that a risk is the possibility that a given climate change stressor will affect your organizations  ability to meet its goals. Stressors and goals are embedded in the risk. You could be prevented from  reaching a goal because the environment changes in some way or because the projects you undertake  to reach your goal would fail in some way.  If there is any potential sequence (climate change stressor, and what follows) for an unwanted  consequence (not reaching your goal), then you have a risk. The risk develops along the path between  the cause and the effect. For example:  Stressor X could , and the result is that we might not attain Goal Y.   Warmer water (stressor) could lead to bacteria being more abundant in the river (path), and we  might not be able to provide healthy drinking water (unrealized goal).   More intense precipitation (stressor) could lead to flooding that knocks a sewage pump station  offline (path) and we might not be able to treat all the sewage that is discharged to the bay  (unrealized goal).  Sea level rise (stressor) will lead to more beach erosion (path) and we might not be able to  maintain the endangered bird species nesting sites (goal). Figure 3-1. The top diagram depicts an ideal business as usual scenario. At your place, your  organization undertakes various projects that help you to achieve your goals. In the bottom diagram a  climate change stressor is introduced to the business as usual situation (or to a no-action scenario). The  stressor could change the way the environment functions or change the effectiveness of the projects  that you would undertake, and potentially lead to unrealized goals. After the stressor is introduced, if  you can describe some chain of events that could happen that might keep you from realizing a goal,  then you have a risk. Local environment + Organizational projects Business as usual Climate change stressor Achieve goal Achieve goalBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 26 Step 3 Paths can be simple or complex. Paths might involve contingencies or future human activity.  A diagram of a system can be very helpful for visualizing how climate change stressors could alter its  operations. It is not necessary to have climate change stressors in the diagram; the illustrations are just a  tool to help you think about where stressors could introduce unwanted effects. Diagrams can be simple  sketches of sequential events (Figure 3-2). If you can easily locate a conceptual diagram (Appendix D)  for a system comparable to yours, then a tool like that can be useful as well. Diagrams do not have to be  comprehensive or even exact representations of reality. They are simply tools to help you brainstorm and  identify risks. Most strategic initiatives are built on existing processes, and much of the organization is involved in the day-to-day work of delivering service to our customers. The Postal value chain is a series of closely linked processes, supported by a common infrastructure.  The overall quality and cost of the system depends not only on the actions of the Postal Service, but also on the actions of mailers and mail service providers. Value Chain U.S. Postal Service Figure 3-2. A visual depiction of the current system helps with identifying risks. Climate change  stressors like increasing storminess or hotter summers can be imagined to affect efficient mail delivery  in many ways. A diagram like this, from the USPS FY 2012 Annual Report to Congress, helps prompt  questions such as How would more wind and rain affect maintenance at post offices? Would hotter  conditions require more air conditioning? Does increasing temperature affect vehicle or aircraft  operations? Would more intense precipitation or more heat alert days affect mail delivery? You  might have come up with these risks even without an illustrationbut if you can have a diagram that  helps you think, then use it. What you need to do Every path that you can conceive is a risk to a goal and should be recorded in this risk identification step.  At this point, you need to rely on your expertise and knowledge about your system. In this step you want  to come up with as many of those possible pathways as you can.  Cross each climate change stressor with each of the goals you listed in Step 2. The intent is to  generate a list of the ways that each stressor could keep you from reaching the goal. This is much like  a brainstorming session. See Figure 3-3 for an example of how the process works for one goal and one  stressor.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 27 Step 3 Figure 3-3. An example of how to generate a list of what could happen in the space between  introduction of a stressor and failure to realize a goal. Record each risk (stressor, path and goal) in Table 3-3. If a potential risk is not identified in this step, it  will not move forward in the vulnerability assessment process, so write down everything. Step 4Risk  Analysis and Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks are where you analyze and evaluate the list of  risks you generate in this step. Dont dismiss risks! Even risks that you might think are insignificant should be captured in this step. Dont prematurely  dismiss anything. You may learn that a stakeholder thinks it is important, or in some instances further  analysis might show that a risk is not trivial at all. If you dismiss it now, it does not get considered later.  If it is in fact a trivial risk, the systematic process of risk management allows it to be assigned to such  a category in Step 4. Treat this step as a brainstorming session and document every risk you and your  team can identify. Risks are not inevitable A risk is not certain to happen, a risk could happen. You will analyze its likelihood in Step 4. Further, if  you decide that you want to change its likelihood, understanding the risk path could help you to find  ways to take action. You probably cannotby yourselfchange a stressor coming from global climate  change, and you probably dont want to change your goal, so if you do want to change the likelihood or  consequence of the risk you have to disrupt the path that transfers the risk from stressor to goal.  More than one problem from the same cause The same environmental stressor may intersect with several of your goals. You may find that you  seemingly identify the same risk many times. As an example, sea level rise may push saltwater farther up  rivers. This could have implications for drinking water sources, freshwater wetlands or shellfish habitat.  This is why you are asked to note which organizational goal is associated with a risk. Goals are implicitly  embedded in risks. In this sea level rise example, you really havent identified the same risk of saltwater  Warmer water   Toxicity of pollutants  may increase   Water can hold less  dissolved oxygen   Greater algae growth  may occur   Parasites and bacteria  have greater abundance,  survival or transmission Climate change stressor Paths Unrealized goal Maintain water qualityBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 28 Step 3 reaching farther upstream three times: you have identified three separate risks that stem from the same  stressor-driven process. You might design an adaptation action for the drinking water risk that leaves the  other two risks intact: they really are three different risks.  Help identifying risks This step has four tables (Tables 3-1a through 3-1d) that cross-reference the seven types of climate  change stressors with the purposes of clean water legislation to provide a starter list of more than 100  potential risks. If your organization has other types of goals, then add those goals to a table like Table  3-2 and identify the relevant climate change risks. More places to turn for risk references are listed in the  Additional Resources section. Opportunities (possibility of benefits) You might identify potential circumstances arising from any of the seven climate change stressors that  could be beneficial instead of harmful. These may reduce the severity of some other risk or just be  positive outcomes on their own. If it is the latter, an opportunity may free resources to address other  risks or even change the way your organization goes about business. If you identify any opportunities  related to your organizations goals, make note of them. They will be picked back up in your action plan  to ensure that you take advantage of them.", "67": "Process This is the most intensive step of the vulnerability assessment. You will use Table 4-1 to characterize each  risk in five areas: (1) consequence, (2) likelihood, (3) spatial extent of the impact, (4) time horizon until the  problem begins, and (5) habitat type. This will become important information when your organization  determines its adaptation priorities.  Each risk needs to be assigned to the minimum number of people or teams (ideally just one) who can  provide a reliable initial analysis. You need an initial analysis of each risk along with some documentation  of the sources (which could be expert judgement). Try not to get stuck on determining the likelihood  or consequence of any one risk. Right now this will be an initial or a working determination. As more  information becomes available over time, or as others are able to assist, you can return to this step and  adjust the determination accordingly.  Whereas the Workbook methodology brings others into the process in Step 5, it could be desirable to  include others now if stakeholders indicated that they would help you with this part of your vulnerability  assessment. The involvement of more than one person can lead to differences in whether risks are rated  high, medium or low. The intent of this step is to provide one initial rating so that it can be refined via  wider consultation and participation in Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks. If you do receive  divergent input in this step, you need to come to a conclusion about which rating you will provisionally  adopt. Differences could be worked out here or postponed to Step 5. Figure 4-1. In this step, each risk from the list compiled in Step 3 is separately assigned to someone  (or to a team) who is qualified to come up with qualitative determinations of likelihood, consequence,  spatial extent, time horizon or habitat type. Others will be invited to review these determinations in  Step 5.", "68": "How precise do you need to be? This process requires a determination of the relative importance of each risk. You want to sort risks into a  fitting high-medium-low category: absolute precision is not needed.  Your aim in this step is to have risk determinations that are not wrong. Wrong would be saying high  and later changing a rating to low or vice versa. If the rating is believed to be correct, if you could  make a decent argument as to why you rated it that way and you do not expect to be changing it, if you  would be open to revision if compelling new information were provided, then that is sufficient precision  for this step. It is recommended that you use available information to rate a risk, as you will likely have many risks that  you have to work through and launching a bevy of new research studies will be impractical. Indicate how  the determination was made and what information or who was consulted, and move on to the next risk.  As new information surfaces and others are later able to provide additional information, you can revisit  the determination and adjust it if necessary.", "69": "Who should participate? How you choose to complete your initial risk analysis will be highly influenced by staff capabilities and  interests, as well as by the size, subject fields and availability of the expert pool you turn to. Three main  types of people should be invited to participate in this step: Your in-house staff: No one knows your program as well as the staff. If they have the ability to make a  first determination about the risks, then you should let the staff do as much as they can. Working on this  will also raise their knowledge about climate impacts. Experts: You probably already turn to specialists or professionals whenever you need to go beyond  your in-house knowledge or skills. Experts in climate, environmental sciences or natural resources from  government agencies, universities, NGOs or consulting companies who are familiar with your study  area could assist your staff with this climate change risk analysis. Experts could also be asked to do  the analysis themselves. Local experts (like the director of a public works department or professional  landscapers) can also contribute. They might in fact be the best people to estimate the consequence of  a risk. Partners: When you did your initial stakeholder consultation, people may have indicated that they had  expertise or knowledge in particular domains. It will be useful to bring those experts back into the  process now, especially if they said they could help with this step. For example, it may be useful to have  the president of the fishing club weigh in on the consequences of warmer water. You can approach different people about likelihood and consequence ratings for the same risk. For  example, you might ask climate experts about the likelihood of a risk and turn to in-house staff for a  determination of its consequences or its spatial extent.", "70": "If you turn to experts or selected stakeholders Carefully consider which risks you would like an expert or selected stakeholders to weigh in on and  whether you would like them to comment on the likelihood or consequence (or both) of that risk. Keep  in mind that the goal here is to generate an initial analysis. Consult with those who can fill in gaps with  particular, needed expertise. In Step 5 you will share what you have done more broadly to help reach  agreement. In this step, you only should do what is necessary to get off to a good start.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 38 Step 4 If you reach out to others in this step, it will be helpful to communicate the following information:   An overview of the vulnerability assessment process, including identification of your organizations  goals.  Which risks you would like their input on and whether you would like their determination on the  likelihood or consequence (or both) of that risk.  That a qualitative scale is being used to determine the likelihood and consequence for each risk see What you (or those you consult) need to determine below.  The level of effort that is or is not needed right now.  That a justification, rationale or source for their input would be helpfu", "71": "What you (or those you consult) need to determine Risks will be ranked on a qualitative scale for consequence, likelihood, spatial scale of the impact,  and time horizon. It is helpful to note the justification or source used to determine the likelihood and  consequence of each risk, as it will be a useful reference later on in the process (if you need to revisit this,  or to find out more when you are planning adaptation actions).  The Workbook uses scales with three divisions (high-medium-low). In order for this exercise to be most  useful, you must have a spread of likelihoods and consequences for the risks identified. If everything is  ranked as high-likelihood and high-consequence, the vulnerability assessment process is going to be less  effective as a decision-making tool. In the situation where a disproportionate number of risks are falling  into the high category, you should probably expand your definition of medium to capture more risks.  It may be helpful to define what each category (high-medium-low) means for your organization. Note that in the descriptions below for each parameter, the qualitative category (a) is always best and  (c) is the worst.  Consequence Consequence is the effect the risk would have on your organizations goal were it to occur.  (a) Low (life will go on; not as important as many other things; could adjust) (b) Medium (c) High (major disruption; goal is out of reach or not even attainable) Likelihood Likelihood is the chance of the risk actually occurring (i.e., probability). For the risk, you determine how  likely it is to affect the goal.  (a) Low (b) Medium (c) High For planning purposes you can avoid attaching quantitative probability labels to categories. Unless you  have access to a large team of top scientists and a lot of supercomputers for simulating the climate at the  scale of your study area and running the appropriate hydrological, hydraulic, demographic, land use, and  ecological models, your mathematical estimate of probability is not going to be any more accurate than  the qualitative category anyway.  Since this is a qualitative analysisto aid future decision-making by spreading the risks over three  categories, you could define your likelihoods so that 20%40% of your risks fall in each of the high- medium-low groupings (unless you have a large number of risks that are not likely to occur). All the risks  in the high category would be more likely to occur than those in the medium category, and likewise for  medium and low. Spatial extent Spatial extent refers to the proportion of your geographic area that the risk will affect (recall that the  Introduction states that this Workbook methodology works best at a spatial scale that is large enough  that risks are numerous and diverse and small enough that managers know the territory). Knowing  whether problems are isolated or widespread will help you in the action planning process as you decide  how best to use limited resources.  (a) Site (e.g., a few waterfront lots, a bridge, a sewage treatment plant) (b) Place or region (e.g., community, harbor, state park, wildlife refuge, sub-watershed) (c) Extensive (most of the watershed or most of the estuary) If a different spatial scale is more appropriate for your situation, then feel free to modify these  categories.  Sidebar elaboration on why qualitative scales are emphasized for use in this workbook.  Using a qualitative scale A qualitative scale at this stage is useful for several reasons:  Future changes in the climate system cannot be projected with the exactness that is needed to precisely  quantify the probability of a risk at any given future time.   You might need to contend with well over a hundred distinct risks. It would be prohibitively expensive  to scientifically quantify the likelihood of each one, as well as to estimate the cost of damages each risk  poses. The cost of doing the risk assessment should not exceed the cost of mitigating risks themselves.  The general public has a poor ability to process statistical probability. Research on decision theory  shows that giving people mathematically identical choices elicits different responses depending on how  a problem is framed.   It will be much easier to reach agreement on a qualitative rank (high-medium-low) than on whether  mathematical calculations of likelihood or consequence were done correctly. Some people might elect to use numbers to express a qualitative value (e.g., rank 15). Keep in mind  that these numbers are probably symbolizing subjective values because there is no easy mathematical  way to accurately derive one true quantitative value for each risk. If you are using numerals to represent  opinions, they are still categories. Unless going from category 1 to 2 truly represents the same  quantitative change as going from category 3 to 4, and respectively likewise for all the other numerical  relationships, you cannot properly add, multiply or divide with the numerals, or find their mean (although  median and mode are valid).  Be sure to look ahead to Step 5 and Steps 68b to understand how these categories will be used if you  are tempted to increase the number of categories or to do math with them. Is it really going to be helpful  to use 5-point scales or 10-point scales to generate 25 or 100 different classes of risk? Are you actually  going to use that level of differentiation to make decisions? The key thing here is not to overcomplicate the  process.

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 40 Step 4 Time horizon Time horizon until the problem begins will help with developing your action plan. Decisions about low  or medium problems that will not emerge for decades could be postponed. Conversely, high-impact  problems that are already occurring need some attention right away.  (a) More than 30 years (b) 1030 years (c) Already occurring or 010 years Treat the time horizon for the risk as being independent of the likelihood of it occurring. If you think that  absolute dates are more appropriate than relative time periods, choose whatever works best for your  situation. Habitat type Habitat type is a category that is not necessarily a risk dimension. Identifying it now as you go through  your risk analysis and develop your table will become useful later when you work on an action plan in  Steps 610. When deciding on adaptation actions, you may want to group all of the risks associated  with a certain type of habitat. You might, for example, want to see all of the risks associated with tidal  wetlands or with residential areas. Looking across all the associated risks can help you choose adaptation  actions that address more than one risk.", "72": "How to proceed when climate projections give a range of answers Environmental managers have always had to deal with uncertainty when making decisions. It is important  to be transparent about the magnitude of the uncertainty, the range of possible outcomes, and the  resulting justification for making a specific decision. Nevertheless, sufficient information currently exists  to make good determinations about whether a risk is likely to lead to small or large problems. For the purposes of this analysis, knowing the direction  of the change is often enough. For example, you do not  need to determine whether sea level will be 1.25 feet, 1.5  feet or 1.75 feet higher 45 years from now. Instead, think  about what your system will be like when sea level is 1.25  feet, 1.5 feet or 1.75 feet higher in the coming decades.  Similarly, you probably do not need to determine whether  it is going to be 4F or 6F warmer. Think about what the  impacts will be at the low and high ends of your annual  temperature range when temperatures are consistently  warmer than they are now, or phenomena happen earlier  in the spring or later in the fall.  Sidebar elaboration on why the workbook methodology might not be suited for all problems.  Urgent problems Ultimately, if the scale or urgency of a  problem is so big that planning estimates  are not adequate, then you have to turn  to other risk management techniques  for those risks. The methodology of this  Workbook is not the right approach for  problems that need precise, quantified  answers. See Appendix C. End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 41 Step 4 As you are assessing your risks, it may be helpful to indicate the level of certainty associated with each  risk. When you evaluate the risks in Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks and later decide which  ones to move forward with in your action plan, you may find that there are some risks for which there is  great uncertainty and you need more information before investing resources to mitigate them.  When using the Workbook methodology to conduct a vulnerability assessment, use the best available  information and use an iterative process that allows you to reassess the identified risks as new  information arises.  How to proceed when climate projections give opposing answers As you move through your risk analysis, you may discover a situation in which climate projections indicate  different directions of change. For example, while examining the likelihood of more frequent drought  for your watershed, you might discover that some climate models show there will be more precipitation  events and less drought, while other models say that drought conditions will become more frequent. There are lots of climate models, and several standard scenarios that each could run. Because each  model is slightly different and the scenarios differ in their assumptions, every combination will have  a different result than every other simulation. Sometimes model results cluster in a narrow range;  sometimes that range is wider; sometimes the range includes both positive and negative projections of  change. How to proceed is related to how confident you would be about deciding on one direction of change  and its approximate magnitude. Your answers to the following questions about model outputs can  influence your decision:  Do you have an outlier model?  Do you have a continuous range of model results that happens to encompass zero?  Do you have two clusters of model results?  Do you have model results that are scattered all over the place? If your sense is that there is enough of a modeling consensus for you to move forward, then proceed.  But if your sense is that the best available climate change information is saying that anything could  happen, then in the process of gathering more information you have now identified a condition that  might lead to new risks. New risks come because your conclusion that climate could change in opposite ways has introduced a  new stressor. To continue the drought example, the increasing drought stressor would remain and you  would now have an opposite less-frequent drought stressor too. You might not think that less-frequent  drought is a stressor, but it is a change from current conditions and that could lead to some unwanted  changes in the environment. The potential for new risks might best be handled by returning to Step 3 Risk Identification and generating a new set of risks that would stem from the opposite stressor. Then  come back to this step with any newly identified risks. You will have to decide how to allocate likelihood  for the risks associated with the stressor pair. If you concluded that anything could happen then you  probably should not assign high likelihood to risks related to either half of the duo.", "73": "Thresholds or tipping points Tips occur when small actions, events or changes have large effects on future states. Environmental  systems that respond to climate changes by crossing thresholds will complicate your risk analysis. When BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 42 Step 4 an ecological threshold is reached, things that were changing gradually (if at all) suddenly change  abruptly. A low impact suddenly becomes high, or a local problem is suddenly everywhere, or a present/ absent switch occurs. Even if you do not know when a tipping point will be reached, you might be able  to anticipate that it will be reached. When sea level rise will push salty water upstream to a sensitive  freshwater marsh, or when the winter will become a frost-free season, cannot be known precisely.  However, anticipating these thresholds will better prepare you in the event that they do occur.  A risk could have a set of determinations about consequence/likelihood/area/timing that apply before  the threshold is reached and another for after. One strategy would be to split the risk into two risks: a  before-after pair. An alternative is to keep the risk intact and proceed with your risk analysis by answering  some questions:  Do you need to take action anyway? If this is a risk that will warrant attention even before a  threshold is reached, how you choose to respond may also affect the onset of the transition.  Mitigating a low risk now may head off the change to a high risk later.  Is the threshold reversible? If it is crossed, can you take actions that would undo the change, or  is it a one-way transition? Losing an endangered species is irreversible. Sometimes reversing the  change is theoretically possible but unrealistic. Try to stay in the plausible part of the spectrum.  How long will an effective response take? If you must respond to the risk if you do cross the  threshold, is the time to adequately respond short or long? If the consequences after crossing the threshold are high, and (because of permits, costs or other  foreseeable problems) it would take a long time to effectively respondwhether before or after a  tipping point is reachedthen this is a high risk, even if the time of onset is unknown.", "74": "Use existing information This application of the risk management process is intended to be completed with existing information  and resources. New fine-scale climate modeling is not required for the type of qualitative analysis this  vulnerability assessment supports, but use it if it already exists and is easy to obtain.  At the time of this publication, climate model outputs for monthly temperature and precipitation are  easily available for U.S. counties or finer resolutions.3  These should be more than sufficient for a planning- level vulnerability assessment where you are looking to sort risks into high-medium-low categories.", "75": "Process After the people you consulted in Step 4 provide you with an initial analysis of your risks, you have  an opportunity to turn to a wider set of people. Your partners and stakeholders can react to the  determinations about consequence and likelihood, and help you to make sure they are accurate. Create a consequence/probability matrix A C/P matrix is a useful communication tool and will help  guide decision-making about which risks your organization  will address in your action plan. In Step 4Risk Analysis you determined an initial consequence and likelihood for  each risk. In this step you will map each risk to a cell or box  on a matrix using those characteristics. You will create a  matrix like the example in Figure 5-1.  ", "76": "Ask your stakeholders and advisors to help Once you have your C/P matrix, reach out to the key  stakeholders and partners for their input or concurrence in  order to verify that you were on the right track in previous  steps. You can reach out to individuals separately or  convene a workshop. You can ask some people to just  look at some of the risks. There are many ways to get feedback on your initial risk analysis. The more  knowledgeable people who can review your C/P matrix, the better (up to the point of diminishing  returns). You may find it useful to mark up your C/P matrix (which could be done separately for each goal,  stressor or habitat type, or which may span several sheets of paper if printed) to include information from  stakeholder consultation. You could also track input with additional notes to Table 4-1.  There are advantages to asking others to participate. However, do this prudently: the primary purpose  here is to get the best risk evaluation you can get. You do not want this to turn into a vote about what  is important, nor do you want people angling for their issues to get ranked higher. The vulnerability  assessment is about risks to your organizations goals. Try to keep that the focus. Ask for thoughts on your risk analysis:  Do they generally agree with how the risks are placed in the C/P matrix?   Are there additional risks (pertaining to your organizations goals) that should be added to the  matrix? Ask for feedback about the risks themselves:  Are any of them priority risks for your stakeholders? Alternatively, are there any that they do not  want to be addressed?  Are there stakeholders or partners who are working to address any of the risks through their own  programs?", "77": "Reaching agreement Each risk can have only one ranking for its likelihood and one ranking for its consequence.

Revise the tables you created in Step 4Risk Analysis as well (be especially sure to keep track of the  reasons for any updates you make).

Congratulations!  There is a lot of work to do still, but you are off to a great start. Use your vulnerability assessment and the C/P matrix as a communication tool. It may be helpful to do  the following:   Publish it online so that it is available within your community.

You could find  that some of your goals will be difficult to attain if the climate changes as expected.

Partners will be essential in the action  planning half of climate change adaptation too. They can help you deal with risks that you may not be  able to handle yourself. Solving problems together, dividing up tasks, identifying lead agencies, and  finding who can contribute human or financial resources will help everyone to achieve your common  goals. Although all of the risks you identified in your vulnerability assessment could prevent you from achieving  your goals, your organization may not be able to mitigate every risk. The availability of partners who  can help with a risk may make a big difference in the approach you select. Be aware that some of your  contextual limitations may apply to your partners as well. Use Table 6-2 to note any common organizational goals, objectives or work areas where potential  partners could help you. This list does not represent a commitment by either party.

To accomplish the objective of this step requires a little bit of finessing the chicken and egg dilemma. In  a systematic methodology, like the one this Workbook uses, when you have scores of risks and limited  resources, the dilemma is:   You can choose to mitigate each risk or use some other risk handling approach for each one.  Should you decide your approach before you even know whether there would be any suitable  mitigating actions you could take?  Investigating the options for mitigating a risk will take time and resources. You already know how  many risks are in your vulnerability assessment and that you might never be able to mitigate  each one; further there will be some that you know you never will act to mitigate. Should you still  expend the effort to investigate options for mitigating every risk so that you can make a logical  informed choice about whether to mitigate them? Basicallyshould you decide what to do and then investigate it further, or when you cant do everything  should you still investigate it all before deciding what to do? Trying to have one logical, systematic  process is what introduces the procedural difficulty. By definition, there is no easy way to resolve a  dilemma, but you will try to make it a smaller problem from two directions:  First you will get some familiarity with the mitigating actions that are circulating in the planning  world. Knowing that options might exist for your situation will help you to decide whether  mitigating any risk looks likely to succeed.   Second, because mitigation requires you to expend resources, you will try to screen out risks that  seem suitable for another approach. You want to filter the set of risks to decide where you will focus your resources. The idea is to head out  of this step with a reduced set of risks that you would prefer to mitigate and for which you might be able  to supply an appropriate mitigating action. Recording your high-level approach for each risk in Table 7-1  will set you up for Step 8aFinding Adaptation Actions and Step 8bSelecting Adaptation Actions,  where you will make finer deliberations about how and whether to proceed.

The Climate Ready Estuaries Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas, as well as other  documents (see the Additional Resources section of this step and Step 8a), will provide a sense for  what might work for your location and combination of risks. You might also recognize that some actions  address more than one risk.  While you will not be selecting actions in this step, having some familiarity  with ones your organization could take will be helpful. A fair amount of  work remains in Step 8a and Step 8b before you will select a specific  mitigation technique to use. Do not be too critical right now. In the same  way the Workbook advises not to dismiss risks while you are preparing  your vulnerability assessment, you should not dismiss actions here right  now. You will be tempted to bring in your organizations context or other  knowledge to eliminate possible actions. However, judgments about how  realistic something is will be coming back into this very soon.  For this part of Step 7, just understand what kind of mitigating actions are  in circulation and use your professional knowledge to simply think about  whether any would work to lower your risks if you (or someone else) could  implement them", "85": "Approaches for each risk Although these decisions will be made at a high level, you are deciding an approach for risks that  you determined have the potential to affect your organizations ability to meet its goals. You need to  be prudent as well as aware that how you choose to approach your risks will determine where your  adaptation actions are focused going forward. Your context and constraints will have a big influence on the approach you select. It will be helpful to  consult partners and stakeholders as you determine the approach for each risk. Some risks may be very  important to a stakeholder group, or work may already be underway to address other risks. It will also be  helpful to consider the spatial scale of the impact. You may opt for a different approach depending on  whether it affects a small or large area.  Risk management uses four general approaches for responding to any given risk:  Mitigate.  Transfer.  Accept.  Avoid. Mitigating a risk is the one approach in which your organization would be making changes to the risk  path (Step 3). The other approaches handle risk more administratively.", "86": "Mitigate Mitigating a risk involves taking actions to reduce the likelihood and/or consequence of the threat to  your goals. ", "87": "Transfer Transfer is a technical risk management term for having another organization take responsibility for  reducing the risk. Your risk is mitigated by another party. Buying an insurance policy is an example of  transferring risk by having another party reduce the consequences if the risk occurs. An environmental  management organization will probably not be buying insurance policies, but transfers can occur when  other organizations will act in ways to reduce your risks. Maybe your risk could be mitigated when a  highway is rebuilt or as part of other infrastructure work. Maybe you can agree to lead a reforestation  effort if a partner agrees to restore some other habitat. Maybe some agency has announced it will  be taking hazard mitigation actions that would have the co-benefit of reducing some of your risk. If  others actions are lowering the likelihood or consequence of your risks then you have transferred the  risk reduction responsibility to them. You arent mitigating the risk, but it is being reduced. Note that  you cannot unilaterally transfer a risk. Other organizations need to affirm that they will actually mitigate  the risk; otherwise the risk will still be there. You can opt to transfer some of a risk by partnering with  another organization or by making a financial contribution to someone elses mitigation project. If you  are working with partner organizations on your adaptation plan, this is an opportunity to decide which  organization is going to be the lead for which risks.", "88": "Accept You may have to consider accepting a risk if you are unable to mitigate or transfer it through a viable  strategy. Accepting a risk means that your organization will continue with business as usual and run the  risk, dealing with the impact if/when it does occur. You might choose to accept a risk for some time,  and then later begin to work on mitigating it. Reasons to accept a risk could include a long time horizon  before impacts are expected, inability to locate a suitable mitigation strategy, or a lack of worry about  the consequence of the risk. If more resources or information become available, you can re-evaluate and  decide if there is an opportunity to use another approach besides accept for a risk.  If you dont make a choice to use any other approach, then by default you have elected to accept a risk.  You are running the risk", "89": "Avoid The mitigate/transfer/accept approaches assume that you do not want to change your organizations  goals. If those three approaches are not feasible for you, then you may want to avoid a risk by narrowing  goals that are related to this risk. Avoiding is about being out of the risk altogether so it will not affect  you. Typically, avoiding a risk involves eliminating its root cause. However, since your organization by  itself will not stop climate change from occurring, and since you cannot relocate your place, avoiding  a risk in this context would require a shift in your organizations operations or goals so that you are no  longer exposed to that risk. For example, if one of your goals is to maintain some resource, but you  conclude that climate change is making that a lost cause, you could relinquish that goal. Avoiding a  risk does not mean the impact to the resource or to your place goes awaythis is an administrative  handling of risk in which you move away from this objective and you will no longer put resources toward  it. Avoiding a risk may be a radical move for an organization: you will be pulling back from work that you  thought was important. Reserve this approach for risks that will not be mitigated (by you or others) and  where accepting the risk is a bad proposition.", "90": "Avoid vs. accept The Workbook often states that if more information becomes available you should go back to earlier  steps. In the iterative process of risk management, choosing avoid for a risk appears to be something  new that has lots of other implications for your adaptation plan. If you are renouncing a goal, then all the  risks you identified in Step 3, which derive from that goal, would seem to vanish too. Thus those risks  would fall out of your matrix and vulnerability assessment. If they are not in your vulnerability assessment,  they would not make it into this step of action planning either. Logically, deciding to avoid a risk makes it  and everything related to it disappear. Instead of acting right away on this logic, you should let your choice of avoid sit for now. The  implications to your risks and goals arising from an iteration do not go away but are not an immediate  problem. Instead, you want to leave open the possibility that even more information could be coming.  The risk may turn out to be more benign than you thought; a new risk mitigation technology might  emerge; a new partner may agree to help you with the risk; windfall funding might come in; etc. If you  expunge the risk and the goal from your vulnerability assessment and action plan, you have nothing to  go back to if you do get more information. Keep the risk and the goal, and keep track of the fact that  you chose to avoid the risk. Things might change that would eventually let you select a mitigate/transfer/ accept approach.  Tracking a risk you choose to avoid keeps a goal on the books. You stop working on the goal itself but  do not drop it completely. Pragmatically, it really does not matter what your goal is or is not if you are  not going to put any resources into trying to reach it. The difference between the accept and avoid  approaches to a climate change risk thus become the difference between business as usual toward a  goal and no action toward a goal. Tabl", "91": "hoosing an approach for each risk Every risk that is on your matrixwhether in the high, medium or low categoryrepresents a potential  event that you determined could keep your organization from meeting its goals. In many cases you can  transfer all or some of the risk to a partner, you can simply accept and run a risk, or you can change your  goals so you avoid it altogether. If these are feasible or palatable then they are what you should do.  What you cannot transfer and do not want to accept or avoid, you must mitigate yourself. Mitigating a risk: Every risk that has a potential action that could lower it could be assigned to this  category. Actions that are easy, that you would do in pursuit of no-regrets or win-win solutions, or that  you simply think your organization should do, should be in this category. Accepting a risk: If you turn to your vulnerability assessment, you will find a time horizon determination  for each risk. All green risks in your C/P matrix (Step 5) are good candidates for an accept approach. The  farther out in time they seem to be, the better the accept approach gets. Yellow risks that are decades  away are also good candidates for the accept approach. Not accepting a risk: Risks with a high impact (red risks in your C/P matrix) are bad candidates for the  accept approach. You and your team identified these risks as highly likely to derail your organization. In  order to continue to function as an effective organization that can meet its goals, you should probably  choose another approach for these high-impact risks.  Risks you could accept but should assign for mitigation: These are the green risks that are happening  now as well as the yellow risks that are expected within the next 1030 years. The green risks are low- consequence problems anyway, and you have some time to respond to the yellow risks (unless the  response requires a very long lead time). Assigning them to the mitigation approach has the potential  advantage of keeping them moving through your adaptation planning steps.  If you assign these green or yellow risks to the accept approach, they will be out of sight and out of mind  as you create your action plan. The advantage of bringing them forward is that they will be in front of you  when you are trying to decide the mitigating actions you do need to pursue. Actions that might address BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 61 Step 7 higher risks could address these lower risks too. You might select some actions over others if you are  actively aware that they address lower risks too. Carrying these risks into the mitigation planning (Figure  7-2) may lead to better organizational choices about actions than if the risks are assigned to the accept  approach.", "92": "Further, if the climate changes faster than you expect or if you were too optimistic in your time horizon  determination, then by the time you complete another iteration of your vulnerability assessment, these  unwanted risks may already be upon you.  If you are not sure about mitigation: You are not obligated to start responding, but if you think you  would want to mitigate a risk in the future, then you could benefit from the risk management process  now by assigning it to the mitigation approach. In the systematic risk management process, only those  risks that you identify for mitigation will be carried forward to Step 8a and Step 8b, where you will select  adaptation actions for the risks, and to Step 9, where you will develop your plan. The other riskswhich  you are deciding not to actively mitigate but to transfer/accept/avoidwill be picked up in Step 10 Monitoring and Review after you write your plan. If Step 8a and Step 8b show you that there is not a  viable mitigation strategy for a particular risk, you can return to this step and choose another approach", "93": "Approving the approach After you have investigated and chosen a high-level approach (mitigate/transfer/accept/avoid) for every  one of your risks, your organizations key decision-makers (board of directors, management committee,  staff, and the people who are regularly involved with deciding what you do) should agree before you go  further with your action plan. Your organization is preparing a major strategy document. While this is not  a new strategic plan, it is a statement of how you plan to continue being able to achieve your mission  and goals.  If you selected the avoid approach for any of your risks, you need to carefully think through what this  means. You have chosen to withdraw from whatever goal would be thwarted by the risk. This may be  the whole goal if the goal is narrow (e.g., maintain critical habitat for a particular bird species), or it may  be a part of a goal if the goal is broad (e.g., maintain ecological diversity in your watershed). If you are  deciding to withdraw from pursuing a goal (and thereby in effect rewriting your strategic plan), key  decision-makers should approve this change in course.", "94": "To Get Started You need to mitigate everything that you cannot transfer and do not want to accept or avoid (Figure  7-3). Deciding which risks you want to mitigate may not be the best way to begin. For a first round of  decision-making it may be easier to leave the mitigation option for last, after you have rejected the other  strategies. To get started you should identify the risks that you can transfer to another willing party.  ", "95": "Finding mitigating actions that look promising As you find the points along a risk pathway where opportunities exist to mitigate the risk (Figure 8a-3),  you need to rely on your knowledge about your system to think about what actions might be promising.  You are looking for actions to apply at the relevant spots in the risk path in order to lower the likelihood  or consequence of a risk. Your professional knowledge and training may lead you in certain directions. As you were familiarizing  yourself with options in Step 7, additional ideas may have interested you. If your organization goals are  similar to the Clean Water Act goals, then Table 8a-1 of the Workbook presents the actions from CREs  Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas in a new format that you might find useful. If your  organization has goals specific to the management of water utilities, see resources from EPAs Climate  Ready Water Utilities program. For other sets of organizational goals, the Additional Resources section  at the end of this step points to sources of potential actions.  There are hundreds of potential actions that would alter a risk path and reduce the risks consequence/ probability. Many actions are trivial; some are practically impossible. You want to identify a plausible  range of actions in this step. This is probably not as open-ended a brainstorming exercise as it sounds,  but do not reject things that are novel. You want a range of actions because in Step 8b you may decide  that some are unpalatable for various reasons and should be rejected. Having a plausible range of  actions will help you find opportunities to use actions that might mitigate more than one risk, bring  co-benefits, or open up other opportunities. The best way to solve one particular risk might not be  as advantageous as a second-best way that mitigates other risks too. It is fine (probably desirable) to  identify the same action for more than one risk", "96": "Criteria to assess actions In addition to risk reduction potential, which you conditionally affirmed in the last step, the Workbook uses five other sets of questions (Americas Climate Choices Summary Report, p. 46) to apply to the pool  of potential actions.  Feasibility and effectiveness.  Cost and cost-effectiveness.  Ancillary costs and benefits.  Equity and fairness.  Robustness. Risk reduction potential  You already considered the risk reduction potential of  actions in Step 8a by affirming that you expect each  adaptation action (by itself or by a combination of actions)  to move a risk at least one box on your consequence/ probability matrix. Do you still believe that? Feasibility and effectiveness  Is the action a proven strategy? Are there other  places that have successfully implemented this  action?  Do you have enough time to implement it to prevent  risks from occurring?  Is it politically feasible?  Do you have, or can you get, authority or permission  to implement it?  Is it something your community/stakeholders would  accept? Cost and cost-effectiveness  Is it affordable? Which category does the cost of  the adaptation action fit?  Minor. Sidebar elaboration on what it means to manage for change.  Managing for change Beyond managing for resilience,  the Nations capability to adapt will  ultimately depend on our ability to  be flexible in setting priorities and  managing for change. Prioritizing  actions and balancing competing  management objectives at all scales of  decision making is essential, especially in  the midst of shifting budgets and rapidly  changing ecosystems....Over time, our  ability to manage for resilience of  current systems in the face of climate  change will be limited as temperature  thresholds are exceeded, climate  impacts become severe and irreversible,  and socioeconomic costs of maintaining  existing ecosystem structures, functions,  and services become excessive. At this  point, it will be necessary to manage  for change, with a re-examination of  priorities and a shift to adaptation  options that incorporate information on  projected ecosystem changes.

Very expensive, requiring external assistance.  Overwhelming and impossible.  Is the cost reasonable for the risk reduction an  action would produce?

Some of the most effective options may also be the most  expensive. The conversethe cheapest actions might be  the least effectivealso holds. Later in this step you will  consider how your available resources affect how many  actions you can implement and how much risk reduction  you can achieve. Ancillary costs and benefits  Is the action maladaptive?  Does action in one sector/place cause problems  in another sector/place?  Will action to reduce some risks encourage  people to take other risks they would have  avoided otherwise?  Does the action close off other options or lock  the future onto one path?  Co-benefitsdoes an action create positive side  effects that help with other non-climate problems or  with more than one climate change risk?

Are there adverse impacts on the environment,  ecosystem functions or ecosystem services? Equity and fairness  Does it align with your ethics and principles?  Does it cause a minority population or low-income  population to bear disproportionately high and  adverse effects?  Sidebar elaboration on the definition of sustainability and its three pillars.

Executive Order 13514 of October 5,  2009 The ultimate goal of adaptation is to  create a sustainable place (otherwise  adaptation actions are just patches and  short-term fixes). You want to create  places that will be resilient to the risks  that future climate changes will pose.

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 84 Step 8b  Are many asked to pay for benefits that accrue to just a few?  Does the action limit the adaptation options of other places or sectors? Robustness  Given inherent uncertainty about the future, will the action perform under a range of potential  conditions?  Is it a flexible adaptation action? Can it be modified at a future date if the climate changes  differently than expected?  Are you putting all your eggs in one basket, or is this action part of a coordinated set of actions?  Is it a no-regrets action? Is it just a good idea regardless of how climate might change?   Is it a win-win action? Would it also be a good strategy for achieving other desired social,  environmental or economic results?  Are there any circumstances where you would become sorry you implemented this action? These six tests can have many parts and the tests are not simple pass/fail questions. You are trying  to find actions that are desirable as well as effectiveand you want to avoid problematic actions.  These screening tests are really about deciding whether an action is unsuitable or appropriate for your  organization. Record your conclusions in Table 8b-1 and note whether you are willing to proceed with  each action.", "97": "Reviewing the screening assessment Not every action will pass all the tests. You truly do not want to implement actions that will not work,  that you cannot afford, or that cause other problems, but be alert for ways to compensate for those  problems. Which tests an action fails matter.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 85 Step 8b  If you disqualified an action because you cannot afford it, you might be able to transfer that risk  to others who can pay the costs. Alternatively you may need to focus attention on finding the  funds.  If the impediments are political or structural, then your first acts toward reducing a risk may be to  find ways to overcome those obstacles.  If an action generates unwanted effects, then those tradeoffs might be mitigated too. You may not be able to find any actions for some risks.  If you cannot find a single mitigating action for a risk that passes your screening tests and that you  want to implement, then a potential partner probably will not find one either, so transferring this  risk may not work. You probably need to accept or avoid the risk.   Keep track of actions that failed one or more of the screening tests because conditions may  change over time and these actions may become more attractive in the future. The best actions will pass each screening question. Actions that do satisfactorily on your tests will move  forward for further consideration of their risk reduction potential in the rest of this step.  Risk-based ranking of actions This Workbook assumes (as expressed in the Introduction) that users will have to prioritize response  actions because not all can be implemented. The mitigating actions that pass the six criteria will address  a variety of risks that will affect different goals, that will occur in different habitat types, and that range  from high-impact risks (red in your matrix) to low-impact risks (green).  In a risk management process, the best actions will be the ones that achieve the most risk reduction.  Your task now is to sort all of your screened actions according to how much of your climate change risk  they will mitigate. For each action, you first need to return to the C/P matrix and see whether the primary target of the  action is a red, yellow or green risk. Do a rough sort of your list so that actions that respond to red risks  are at the top, and actions that respond only to green risks are at the bottom (Figure 8b-2, left). What follows is a set of decision-making guidelines that will help you refine the rough sorting. Some  actions are more attractive because they respond to your organizations total risk better than others, and  they should float higher on your list. Note that a group of actions can be assessed as one coordinated  set. Your C/P matrix and the information you developed about the action in Step 8a will help you to  construct the ranking.  Actions that address red risks  Responding to red risks should be at the top of the list. You said these risks are highly likely to  happen and will have high impacts when they do. Actions that would mitigate a red risk should  get priority over responses to a yellow risk.  Actions that reduce more than one risk are more attractive than comparable ones that reduce  only one risk. Be sure the main target risk is making real movement to the lower left of your  matrix. Do not do a little bit for a red risk just because it also does a little for a yellow risk: focus  on meaningfully reducing risk.  Actions that would move red risks closer to the lower left corner of your matrix are more attractive  than comparable actions that would leave them further away. But do not spend a fortune to  mitigate risks down to zero if getting them into the green zone is sufficient.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 86 Step 8b  Do not duplicate efforts unless you intend to. You should not expend resources to implement  more than one solitary action to achieve the same risk reduction, but if an action is part of  a coordinated set of risk reducing actions, that is fine. If an action is part of a planned set of  redundant actions, that is fine too. Actions that address yellow risks  Yellow risks should not be the primary target of your efforts unless you have no red risks. Look for  opportunities to move yellow risks into the green zone as part of your work on other red risks.  You may have an opportunity to take an action that would reduce a few yellow risks instead  of taking another action that would reduce one red risk. This is a judgment call based on the  magnitude of all the contextual benefits each choice could achieve. However, do not work to  clean out the yellow zone while leaving red risks intact. Actions that only address green risks  Actions that respond only to green risks should be at the bottom of your list. You have decided  these risks are less likely to occur and would not matter as much if they did. You probably should  not dedicate any resources to them that would take away from responding to yellow or red risks.   Actions that have negligible costs (in time and money) and can be taken as a part of other normal  business are more attractive than other actions aimed at green risks.  Instead of launching a project aimed at a green risk, look for opportunities to fine-tune an  action you will use to address a red or yellow risk. Maybe those actions can incorporate a small  component that further reduces green risks. After you assess your pool of actions, you should have a relative ranking (like the example on the right  side of Figure 8b-1) of the whole set of actions based on how much of your organizations overall risk they  reduce. This is a risk-based ordering of actions.  Selecting actions for implementation You are setting out to reduce the overall climate change  risk to your organization. A risk-based ordering of actions  means that each action (or coordinated set of actions)  reduces more risk than the item below it on the list. If  you moved actions to be out of sequence on the list  (either further up or further down), then some actions that  reduce less risk would appear higher on your list than  actions that reduce more risk. If you need to prioritize response actions because you will  not be able to implement them all, the next thing is to  divide your actions into two tiers. Tier 1 actions are the  ones your organization has the capacity to start on within  your workplan cycle. Tier 2 is the waiting list. Taking into  account your organizations financial and human  resources, you should draw a line separating the actions into Tier 1 and Tier 2 as far down from the top  of the list as you can in order to maximize the number of actions in Tier 1 (Figure 8b-2). If Tier 1 reaches down to an action that you cannot afford but you can afford more actions below that  particularly expensive one, then: (1) note that one action is too costly and that you are skipping it in this", "98": "work planning cyclebut dont change its place in the ordered listand (2) move the line down so that  as many actions as you can afford are in Tier 1. The actions in Tier 1 generate the most risk reduction you can realize at this time. Tier 1 actions will move  into Step 9 for implementation. The actions that are beyond your current capacity will be in Tier 2 and  will not move forward right now. Actions that you skip are technically in Tier 2, but keep their place in the  ordered list.", "99": "Concept approval In Step 7, you may have worked with your partners to negotiate a transfer of certain risks. You may also  have decided to run some risks by choosing to accept them. You may have decided to avoid some risks.  You decided to try to mitigate the remaining risks. You also confirmed with your key decision-makers that  they concur with the high-level approach for each risk. In Step 8b, you selected promising adaptation  actions for all the risks you intend to mitigate, and you are proposing to move that set forward for project  design and implementation. Before you go further with your action plan, this is another opportunity to  run it by your organization board of directors, management committee, staff, and the people who are  regularly involved in decisions for their concurrence about how you propose to manage your risks. A planning-level plan In this last planning-level step, you will create the  mechanisms to ensure that you make progress. You want  to create two risk management tracking systems. One  tracks the actions; the other tracks the risks. You will create  two tables that start as inverses of each other. Each table  should be updated regularly. The first table (Table 9-1) tracks the actions and notes  which risks they are associated with as well as who has  responsibility for implementing them. An action may  address more than one risk.

As time passes, your context may change, so your plan  will need to be adjusted to suit these changes. Your  organization may take on new challenges and have new  goals. Your budget or personnel may change. Perhaps the  political situation in which you operate evolves. Or maybe  you identify more partners to transfer risks tofreeing up  more resources and time for you to address other risks.  In any case, you will need to review and revise your action  plan to reflect changes in your regulatory, political and  financial context and ensure the plan reflects your current  context. Climate change: New climate change science will likely emerge after you have completed your  adaptation plan. Information about magnitude of projected changes and new knowledge about  expected impacts will continue to be improved. Incorporate new information (e.g., science, data) as it  becomes available so that your plan stays current and effectively addresses your risks.

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 99 Step 10 Risks: Your risks will likely evolve over time as well,  especially as climate changes accumulate or interact. What  used to be a moderate risk could become a more severe  risk over time, one you feel needs to be addressed sooner  rather than later. Your own mitigating actions hopefully  change how you would assess a risk, too. Update your plan  to reflect changes and continue through the subsequent  steps to revise your action plan.  Action plan: Your action plan is meant to be a living  document.

In step 4, the assessment team uses the information in the table to analyze the overall economic  implications for the community. In this step, the team develops a comprehensive picture of local  economic risks and opportunities associated with climate change.

For example, in the Northeast region, the  assessment notes that, Between 1895 and 2011,  temperatures in the Northeast increased by  almost 2F (0.16F per decade), and precipitation  increased by approximately five inches, or more  than 10 percent (0.4 inches per decade). Coastal  flooding has increased due to a rise in sea level  of approximately 1 foot since 1900. 1 These  trends are projected to continue (Figure 5)", "126": "C. Climate Change Impacts on Local Economies  Communities can face many stressors, such as rapid population increases or losses, aging public  infrastructure, economic fluctuations, volatile or unpredictable energy prices, and natural  hazards. Climate change is likely to exacerbate many of these challengesfor example, by  damaging infrastructure, which requires more frequent repair and maintenance and costs local  and state governments more money, or changing environmental conditions in ways that affect  local industries such as fisheries or tourism. A resilient community will continue to thrive in the  face of those stressors.  A resilient community will also find ways to adapt its economy to opportunities that arise from  the changing climate. Opportunities could come from changing consumer preferences,  consumption patterns, demands for new products and services (including those that are climate  resilient), major public infrastructure engineering and construction, and alternative supply chain  services.  Businesses that can operate with minimal interruption during and after extreme weather events  could have a competitive advantage over less-prepared companies. Similarly, communities that  help their businesses prepare and protect their transportation, utilities, and other essential assets  and services could be more attractive to businesses looking for more secure locations.

Community economic development leaders are often interested in longer  range projections to have time to plan for anticipated trends, while individual businesses might  want to look 15 or 30 years into the future, depending on their product or service and lease or  ownership status. The team can consider the objectives and resources that it established in step 1  and select the most appropriate scenarios.  If the community does not have a completed climate vulnerability assessment or other related  studies from which to draw, the team will need to determine what it will use based on how it  intends to obtain climate impact information and what is available.  For the basic approach, communities with no climate change projections for their geographic  area can use regional scenarios developed for the National Climate Assessment and tools from  federal agencies and nongovernmental groups to get a general sense of impacts likely to occur in  their region (see appendix C for links to resources). Some states have more regionally specific  climate change projections, and some regions have also developed finer-grained projections. For  the moderate or advanced approach, the team can work with climate change specialists to  develop finer-grained projections for the community. Many universities have climate change  specialists who could help conduct more in-depth analyses of local climate change projections.  To ensure it can explain and defend the assumptions underlying the assessment, the team should  document the climate change scenarios it selected and why (e.g., data availability or relationship  to the community goals and objectives). The team should keep in mind, however, that just as  communities use demographic, economic, and other estimates and projections in planning and  decision-making, it can use a plausible future scenario such as those described in the National  Climate Assessment as a reasonable basis for the assessment.

The team can summarize the projections of  the depth of the water and the geographic boundary of the inundation area from  the various tools or studies it uses for the selected scenarios. Flood and storm surge: The team can determine the boundaries of the areas  where water is expected to temporarily inundate land to a specific, problematic  depth during or immediately after a storm. Extreme heat and drought: In most cases, the spatial gradient for temperature  and drought conditions will be very low or unnoticeable at the local scale.

It is not necessary to spend a great deal of time refining  this scale. The important thing is to have a consistent basis for distinguishing where climate- related hazards pose the greatest risk to the local economy. The sample assessment form uses high, moderate, low, and none as a scale to help  estimate and compare assets vulnerability to various climate impacts. The team could establish  ranges for each level; for example, a low level of risk might be that 1 to 5 percent of the asset  category could be affected by the climate hazard, a moderate level could be 5 to 20 percent, and  a high level could be more than 20 percent. To bracket the ranges, the team could consider  factors such as value of the assets, potential for collateral impact (i.e., dependence of other  economic activities on those assets), or similar concerns. Ultimately, the team can use whatever  scale it wants based on the communitys context and threats.  Once the team has defined a scale, it can apply it to each identified asset for each climate  change-related hazard.

While these programs often focus on residential properties, some buyout programs include business properties, especially when recent disasters severely affected business districts. When considering whether to include business property owners in a buyout program, a community needs to weigh the total benefits of the buyout with total costs, including the loss of tax revenue if that business relocates outside of the community. The community would want to consider whether the businesses will ever come back, and if not, if the buyout program could help them find another place in the community.

Cisterns capture rainwater to reuse  for irrigation, saving money on water bills  (Figures 27 and 28). Green roofs also  capture runoff and insulate the building,  helping to reduce heating and cooling bills (Figure 29). Adding green infrastructure  elements to parking lots, which along with  roofs are often the largest expanses of  impervious area on a development site, can  reduce stormwater runoff significantly while  also making the lot more attractive and  cooler (Figure 30). Preserving and planting  trees in new development or redevelopment  sites can similarly slow rainfall while  cooling and cleaning the air. Sometimes, incorporating these practices  into a site design can add time and money;  however, it could save both in the event of a  heavy rain storm by reducing runoff,  ponding, and local flooding. Often, if  incorporated into the early site design, green  infrastructure practices can reduce overall  infrastructure development costs.

For example, Recover Green Roofs, a small business in Somerville, Massachusetts, designs,  installs, and maintains green roofs.45  Companies that might be able to move into a climate-related market could conduct formal market research that considers not just past demand but growth projections. Analyze local markets or markets in which the firm already works for entry opportunities. Firms that do not work in a sector that serves a climate market could assess the soft returns on leadership in resilience, such as community or national recognition.  Identify regional innovation hubs working on vulnerabilities in your industry (e.g., materials or shipping solutions), and explore opportunities to partner or pilot technologies or practices. These collaborations could occur with universities, private incubators and accelerators, and small business technology initiatives.  Build relationships with firms doing complementary work in climate-related markets to build a base for partnerships (e.g., through networking events among entities working in this area). A regional cluster in a field of interest provides agglomeration benefits, like innovation opportunities and workforce availability, that can help firms become competitive, particularly firms that are poised to be first to market.

Assemble a Steering Committee To develop an effective sea level rise adaptation plan that reflects  the expertise and interests of the communitys local stakeholders, a  steering committee should be assembled to assist the organization  responsible for writing the plan. Steering committees have the ability  to enhance all ensuing activities in the adaptation planning process.  Because they have a large role in providing data and implementing  actions, local government officials or champions are the best candi- dates to chair or lead the steering committee or working group for the  planning process. However, steering committees can accomplish their  ultimate purpose, to engage the whole community, if they also include  non-governmental representation with strong ties to the community  (e.g., businesses, non-profits, and neighborhood groups", "228": "It is recommended that the planning team recruit a steering commit- tee whose composition is a blend of community champions, knowl- edgeable community development officials, and technical experts that  understand flooding and coastal dynamics. In addition to guidance,  steering committee members may work directly with the adaptation  planning team to write the adaptation plan so that components such  as the Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation Strategies follow pro- fessional standards. Because sea level rise adaptation planning is an  emerging topic, DEP and NOAA urge communities to think of sources  of technical assistance in organizations that routinely address the sub- ject. Universities and their cadres of graduate students, Florida Sea  Grant agents, regional planning council staff, and NOAA Coastal Man- agement Fellows are some examples.  ", "229": "The planning team is encouraged to look to the private sector (e.g., green  building contractors, engineering firms experienced with flood issues),  non-profits (e.g., 1000 Friends of Florida, The Nature Conservancy),  and universities for potential steering committee members. Coastal  biologists, geologists, engineers, public finance specialists, researchers,  and residents with local knowledge may all be able to support adapta- tion planning endeavors. By strategically populating the steering com- mittee, the ensuing activities in the adaptation planning process may  benefit from creative ideas. Another source for steering committee  members can be local mitigation steering committees, floodplain man- agement planning committees, and other similar groups. Participation  by these committees in adaptation planning may even earn the com- munity a bonus in their respective planning processes. The Community  Rating System (CRS) Activity 412.d (Higher study standards) awards  additional credits if the community shows areas that are predicted to  be susceptible to flooding in the future because of climate change or  sea level rise. For this activity, the community must use an estimate  of the anticipated sea level rise that is at least as high as the NOAA  intermediate-high projections for 2100. Thus, involving local flood- plain managers may result in earning CRS points.", "230": "1.2. Set Guiding Principles and Motivations  By determining guiding principles and motivations, the community can  establish its compass for navigating through the remaining components  of the planning process. The guiding principles and motivations are one  of the plans most interactive sub-components and should assist deci- sion-making activities in the subsequent components (i.e., Vulnerability  Assessment, Adaptation Strategies, and Implementation Strategies). The communitys guiding principles and motivations for sea level rise  adaptation planning should be set by the plan development team and  the steering committee. The principles and motivations examine how  the community operates and set its vision for the future which leads  to planning goals. Convening a group to set the overarching goals is  one primary method for identifying and organizing guiding forces into  a single planning process. The principles may align well with goals, and  motivations can be aligned as objectives to meet one or more goals.  Setting goals is also a part of the comprehensive planning process and  Local Mitigation Strategy process (see 44 CFR 201.6 (c)(3)(i)), which are  both recognized at the state and federal level as an important step in  facilitating hazard planning efforts. Communities should ensure that  the goals of their adaptation plan fit well within the goals set by other  planning mechanisms such as their Local Mitigation Strategy, Post-Di- saster Redevelopment Plan, Comprehensive Plan, Historic Preserva- tion Plan, and others if applicable. If the goals from different plans  conflict, then the implementation phase will likely be difficult and may  reach an impasse.", "231": "1.3. Describe the Geographic Context Describing the geographic context delineates the boundaries of the plan- ning area and the assets, buildings, and structures contained therein.  It is important for the planning team to contextualize the physical loca- tion for which a community is planning. Describing the geographic con- text should include maps with the location of the community within  the larger region as well as topographical, hydrological, and zoning  layers that indicate current limitations and opportunities for develop- ment activities. The maps and information developed in this plan sub-component  should support the activities within the Vulnerability Assessment com- ponent. As presented in the Exposure Analysis (see Chapter 2.1) and  Sensitivity Analysis (see Chapter 2.2), maps of the community showing  potential sea level rise are a crucial piece of information for the adap- tation planning process", "232": "1.4. Identify Opportunities for Community  Participation Community members beyond the steering committee should par- ticipate to shape the outcome of the planning process. Examples of  targeted participation opportunities include holding focus group  meetings, conducting workshops, and addressing the topic during  neighborhood gatherings, home owner association meetings, and  town hall (general public) meetings as well as multi-media events such  as broadcasts and surveys. An effective example of Community Partici- pation in a sea level rise planning effort is to walk through a Strengths,  Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis to outline  issues more systematically. Participation activities such as these can  help to build and strengthen stakeholder and community support for  the project as well as serve to highlight concern areas that the plan- ning team may not have previously considered or addressed.", "233": "1.4.1. Stakeholder Identification Stakeholders, those local individuals from a variety of organizations  with interest in community planning and the shaping of the future, are  best identified by determining who and what the planning efforts will  affect.

Utilizing a community outreach strategy, as described  further below, will pull in the most appropriate stakeholders.", "234": "It is the responsibility of the local government officials and the steering  committee to lead the efforts of stakeholder engagement by deter- mining the appropriate organizations and individuals to take part in  the overall process. They must decide on the best option for promot- ing and fostering engagement based on the target audience. Individu- als and groups from all levels of government, including federal, state,  and tribal groups, as well as representative groups from across the  community should be offered the opportunity to participate. Outreach  to vulnerable populations should also be a priority, so they have the  opportunity to participate in the planning process and become vested  in activities that could directly affect them.", "235": "Local Government Officials5 Stakeholder engagement should include local executive-level staff like  elected officials, other local departments with a role in adaptation,  and/or neighboring communities. Local executive staff can bring polit- ical awareness to the planning process that can be a boost to public  engagement. Other departments may have technical or project expe- rience in fields related to adaptation like coastal flooding. In addition,  the planning, zoning, stormwater, and public works departments may  create project scope and manage implementable projects that result  from the planning effort. This guidance during strategic development  will assist future project implementation. Neighboring community  stakeholders may be able to enlighten the community by sharing their  own adaptation or mitigation experience.", "236": "Community Organizations and Leaders  Community organizations and leaders comprise an additional stake- holder group to engage. Connections can be made by reviewing  their event calendars and meeting agendas to find a time and way to  introduce the adaptation planning process and enlist their involve- ment. Potential partners may include church groups, rotary clubs,  civic organizations, homeowners associations, and specific interest  groups. Community partnerships can provide support and local buy-in  to adaptation and resiliency planning efforts. To increase stakeholder  engagement, it is well served to utilize existing community activities  and forums where individuals are already involved.  ", "237": "Major Businesses The local business community has a vested interest in the long-term  success of the overall community and is a natural stakeholder to the  forward-looking adaptation planning process. These businesses may  be directly impacted by sea level rise or work in an industry like real  estate where their book of business may be impacted. Local busi- nesses, especially those that are water dependent or benefit from  coastal proximity, can provide an additional support dimension and  help spread the word as well as provide resources. The insurance  industry is often absent from these discussions but also has a very  valuable perspective.", "238": "1.4.2. Public Outreach Approach Public participation is important for identifying social, cultural, eco- nomic, and physical factors, which need to be considered during the  establishment of guiding principles used to develop community adap- tation strategies. It is also the appropriate avenue for socializing the  plan. When local ideas, concerns, and preferences are considered,  adaptation strategies can be tailored to meet community needs and  desires. Plans and policy that are developed with broad stakeholder  participation are more likely to be well-received and gain public support  when residents have participated in the process from the start. While  some members of the public may not welcome the process initially,  walking them through the various components generally helps estab- lish valid and urgent reasons why sea level rise adaptation is needed.", "239": "General Public Often, members of the public have had experiences in the past that  can significantly contribute to discussions of vulnerabilities and adap- tation possibilities. The wealth of knowledge in the local community  should not be discounted, and every effort should be made to gather  it and use it. The first step is education and awareness, allowing individuals to truly  understand the threats of sea level rise and flooding based on the  effects of total water level. Efforts to educate local stakeholders on  current and future flood hazards can be enhanced by directly engag- ing the public using nontraditional outreach techniques, such as social  media and interviews. Looking ahead, todays youth will be the ones inheriting the full brunt  of sea level rise, greater storm surge events, and extreme precipitation  that leads to devastating floods. Future generations will continue the  task of addressing these climate issues, and some individuals will likely  embrace involvement. Youth can help contribute their skill with things  like social media to enhance the outreach effort. They also can bring  energy, a fresh perspective, dedication to shaping their future, and  willingness to think outside the box to help find innovative ideas and  concepts to advance adaptation planning.", "240": "Community conversations to identify goals should be centered on topics  including:   Background information and critical risks.   The steps that can be taken to reduce risks.   Why adaptation planning efforts are important for the community.   How the proposed strategies will impact the community.   Which proposed strategies the community prefers.   Steps residents can take to assist in community adaptation efforts. In doing so, an informed set of stakeholders may be equipped to add great  value to the critical thinking behind Focus Area prioritization (see Chapter 2.3).", "241": "Outreach Strategies The success of adaptation strategies largely depends upon confidence  in the idea that reductions in long-term risk exposure, combined with  present day mitigation efforts, will be sustained. Outreach is an import- ant activity that can help build this confidence and lead to future action;  however, each communitys outreach strategy will be unique to reflect  local conditions. To ensure that adaptation is well received in the com- munity, simply posting information on the citys website is a first step  although it will not be adequate on its own. Positive public informa- tion efforts that outline what people can do are more likely to impact  behavior. It is not enough that people know they are in a hazardous  area; they need to want to do something about it. Community mem- bers must understand the effects each strategy will have on them and  what actions they can take. Therefore, messaging is very important.  ", "242": "A key public engagement approach is to shift from telling towards  asking about what should be done. Residents are deeply connected  to where they live, and crowdsourcing information can add a new layer  to components like the Vulnerability Assessment (e.g., allow citizens to  tell their personal experiences of how their homes, streets, or the busi- nesses they frequent have been impacted by king tides and pinpoint  these locations on a map with a tag describing the impact).", "243": "It is important to prepare for outreach  and create specific content areas. A com- munity with a proactive outreach strategy  that speaks to specific community social  and political views will have a greater  chance of moving beyond informing to  prompting community members to act.  Determining the different stakeholder  views will lend itself to a more tailored  and appropriate outreach strategy, a chal- lenging task. As part of an early outreach  strategy, it is recommended to incorporate  a chart of the recorded sea levels for the  nearest NOAA tide gauge over the last 50  to 75 years to represent the historic sea  level rise trend. This action should help  establish evidence-based reasons for  approaching adaptation, help get beyond  personal opinions, and start a process of  deeper community conversations about  what to do about sea level rise.", "244": "The following table details a spectrum of stakeholder participation methods, ranging from in-person to internet communication. The planning team is  encouraged to evaluate which method may work best at each of the six public participation points of the adaptation planning process. Method Description Advisory group/task  force Small group of people representing various interests set up to give advice on programs or actions. In this planning process, an  advisory group of more technically oriented individuals may be appropriate for something like Exposure Analysis. App A program that operates on a smartphone. Could be used to poll, disseminate information, or provide services. Charrette Intense, single or even multi-day effort to design something or solve a problem. Field trip Trip to specific location organized so that participants can match mental images to real conditions. Focus group Small discussion group led by a facilitator who draws out in-depth stakeholder input on specific questions. Hotline Widely advertised telephone number that directs callers to someone who can answer questions and collect input. Interview Face-to-face or telephone interaction with stakeholders conducted by the agency or by a third-party representative. Large group/small  group meeting Opening presentation then division into smaller groups to discuss an issue or complete a task. Open house  Event in which the public is invited to visit a location with staffed booths or stations. These stations could include areas with  maps (either paper maps or computer stations) facilitated by the meeting organizers staffed with various subject matters  experts. Poll or Survey Written or oral lists of questions to solicit community impressions/facts about issues at a specific moment in time. Public hearing Formal, single meeting where stakeholders present official statements and positions that are recorded. Public meeting Large public comment meeting where comments are made to entire audience. Referendum A direct vote by the whole electorate on its support of specific proposals. Retreat Concentrated, informal meeting that emphasizes social interaction as well as issue discussion. Social media Information and interactive event and issue marketing carried out through web and app platforms such as Facebook, Twitter,  and Instagram. Story map An interactive, web-based map that provides enhanced information about locations. Town hall meeting Less formal public hearing where stakeholders have the opportunity to speak and/or vote. Website An online resource center that may provide (on the front end) information, interactive data, feedback mechanisms, and (on the  back end) analytics to administrators.

Best Practices in Stakeholder Involvement Best practices in stakeholder involvement and participation are deter- mined by the principles established at the beginning of the planning  process and are the preferred end result of the chosen strategy.  Depending on the type of audience and engagement, the best possible  techniques for stakeholder involvement will vary. All of the best prac- tice strategies may not be applicable for each stage in the adaptation  planning process, but all are factors that can shape how community  involvement may be designed.

This is a step-by-step methodology presented in a logical  sequence that will help lead a community to priority actions and pri- ority areas. The Exposure Analysis visually represents the potential  encroachment of the sea into land areas, and the Sensitivity Analysis illustrates the variety of entities that may be affected by a rise. Each  community may adapt the Exposure and Sensitivity Analyses to suit  their own priorities. With these analyses in hand, the community can  turn its decision making toward assigning Focus Areas. Focus Areas constitute the selected locations where the Adaptation Strategies  component will direct its attention.", "248": "To ultimately write an adaptation plan that reflects the expertise and  interests of the communitys local stakeholders, public involvement  should be included at each step. Community members need to know  about the potential threat of coastal flooding, and they need to know  concrete information about the planning being done to confront it.  Early introduction of sea level rise visualization tools can indicate the  great level of detail that scientists have already committed to project- ing and mapping future change and can be very tangibly felt when  shown in a specific community. Integrating testimonials of those who  have perceived experience with sea level rise can contribute to the  authenticity and local focus of the process. Longtime residents of an  area may contribute valuable information about lost barrier islands or  coastal areas where they once recreated or did business. Often vulner- abilities are brought out by community members that are not evident  from mapping and studies.", "249": "2.1. Conduct an Exposure Analysis An Exposure Analysis uses a sea level  rise projection to answer the ques- tion where qualified by two factors   when (what time horizon  e.g., 10  years, 25 years) and how much (which  sea level rise scenario  e.g., 1-foot  inundation). The where will depend  on which computer model is used (e.g., Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model  (SLAMM); Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH)) to  produce the sea level rise projection. The analysis can depict which areas  in the community are likely to be susceptible to the chosen sea level rise  scenario on a map. There are a variety of methods that can be used to project sea level  rise. These methods range from extrapolating a straight line into the  future based upon historically recorded sea level heights from the  nearest NOAA gauge station to predicting a curve of accelerating sea  level heights based upon Global Climate Model projections. To consoli- date these methods and projections, a number of sea level rise viewing  tools have been created to help visualize the effects of sea level rise on  communities. Examples of these tools are described and categorized  below in Chapter 2.4 and Best Practices are identified in Chapter 2.5.", "250": "Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model  (SLAMM", "251": "Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH)", "252": "Sea level rise viewing tools generally employ different projection data  and levels of resolution (the grid cell size of Digital Elevation Model;  e.g., 2 feet x 2 feet versus 20 feet x 20 feet) to generate a visual expo- sure projection. This projection shows the areas that will be inundated  by future sea level rise. The tools may also measure impacts on dif- ferent categorizations of land. The tools function using different soft- ware. If available, the planning team and community would benefit  from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software when generating  its own exposure map.  Planning teams are encouraged to use the tool that has the highest res- olution (e.g., most elevation readings per unit-area of land) to increase  accuracy. Previous Florida sea level rise assessments have shown that  achieving the highest resolution in a sea level rise tool may require  in-house or contracted specialist GIS work to produce a map of expo- sure specific to the community. The team is also encouraged to use a  software program that meshes well with the way in which the commu- nity currently plans (for instance, when the community prepares to do  a Sensitivity Analysis, leveraging assets already mapped in a GIS layer  from past planning projects saves time and increases accuracy).", "253": "2.2. Conduct a Sensitivity Analysis This Sensitivity Analysis sub-com- ponent builds upon the Exposure  Analysis and is usually conducted  utilizing the same tool that was  used to make the exposure map.  Conducting a Sensitivity Analysis  helps the community to identify  natural resources, structures,  populations, and other features located in areas that are at risk in the  sea level rise scenario projected during Exposure Analysis.  Sensitivity can be defined as the responsiveness of a system to haz- ard impacts.8 The Sensitivity Analysis serves as the opportunity for the  planning team and its steering committee to identify the land uses,  buildings, resources, and people affected by the potential sea level  rise projected by the Exposure Analysis. By mapping all entities in the  communitys jurisdiction, the planning team develops a basic repre- sentation of which entities have the potential to be affected by sea  level rise.  ", "254": "The planning team may introduce and analyze new layers of structural  and population sensitivity by including various characteristics in the  Sensitivity Analysis mapping. For buildings, this may include physical  characteristics that will better respond to sea level rise, such as raised,  floodable, and anchored structures. For natural areas, this may include  information about wildlife, ecosystems, floodplains, water tables, and  industry-supporting habitats (such as oyster coves). For populations,  this can include social demographics, such as household size and  income by census tract. Examples of Best Practices are identified in  Chapter 2.5.", "255": "2.3. Assign Focus Areas With the assistance of the steering  committee and community stake- holders, the planning team may  assign Focus Areas. This sub-com- ponent builds on the identification  of sensitive entities in the previous  step and assigns community pref- erences to areas that will receive a  majority of the adaptation strategy attention. The Focus Areas help  the community designate areas to start their adaptation process and  narrow the field to build a track record of implementation. Deciding on Focus Areas is a step where the planning team engages  the community to address the findings from the Exposure and Sensi- tivity Analyses. It is recommended that before the Vulnerability Assess- ment begins, criteria be established to guide the publics input (e.g.,  Focus Areas are established where critical facilities or infrastructure  are located and/or where the highest affected population resides).  To do this, it is important to convey information about the potential  affected entities to both steering committee members and community  stakeholders and to record their feedback about what should become  a Focus Area and why. Preferential areas which receive steering com- mittee and community attention may then be deemed Focus Areas  that can benefit from adaptation strategies directed toward them  using the following components.", "256": "Deciding on Focus Areas is a step where the planning team engages  the community to address the findings from the Exposure and Sensi- tivity Analyses.

Preferential areas which receive steering com- mittee and community attention may then be deemed Focus Areas  that can benefit from adaptation strategies directed toward them  using the following components.", "257": "Climate Centrals Surging Seas", "258": "FDOT Sea Level Scenario Sketch  Planning Tool", "259": "The Nature Conservancy Coastal  Resilience Mapping Portal", "260": "NOAA Sea Level Rise Viewer", "261": "NOAA Sea Level Trends", "262": "Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI)  (University of South Carolina, Hazard  and Vulnerability Research Institute)", "263": "USGS National Assessment of Coastal  Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise: Coastal  Vulnerability Index (CVI)", "264": "USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System  (DSAS)", "265": "ADvanced CIRCulation Model (ADCIRC)  (University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill, University of Notre Dame,  University of Texas at Austin) ", "266": "Integrated Valuation of Environmental  Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) (Nature  Capital Project)", "267": "NatureServe Climate Change  Vulnerability Index (CCVI) ", "268": "NOAA Wave Exposure Model (WEMo)", "269": "Sea Levels Affecting Marshes Model  (SLAMM) (Warren Pinnacle Consulting,  Inc.)", "270": "Simulator of Climate Change Risks  and Adaptation Initiatives (SimCLIM)  (CLIMsystems Ltd.", "271": "USACE Sea Level Change Curve  Calculator", "272": "Coastal Adaptation to Sea Level  Rise Tool (COAST) ", "273": "NOAA Inundation Analysis Tool", "274": "U.S. DOT Vulnerability Assessment  Scoring Tool (VAST)", "275": "NOAAs Sea Level Trends visualization too", "276": "U.S. Geological Surveys (USGS) National Assessment of Coastal Vulner- ability to Sea Level Rise", "277": "The Nature Conservancy Coastal Resilience Visualization Tool", "278": "The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) i", "279": "The Florida Department of Transportations (FDOT) Sea Level Sce- nario Sketch Planning Tool ", "280": "The Gulf Tools for Resilience Exploration Engine (Gulf TREE) i", "281": "Gulf of Mexico Alliance Resilience Team (GOMA)", "282": "Exposure Analysis As described earlier, the Exposure Analysis sets the parameters that  will guide when and how much to find where sea level rise is likely  to occur. The Exposure Analysis process may be defined in four steps.  First, a sea level rise model is chosen. Secondly, horizon dates (e.g.,  2040, 2070) are selected to guide the models first output. Then the  model calculates static sea level rise elevations (and can also predict  other changes to local coastal landscapes) for how much sea level  rise is probable at the chosen horizon time points. Finally, future inun- dation areas are located (typically within a GIS map window). The out- put of this step is important because it generates a listing or mapping  of the coastal areas that are likely to be impacted. The Exposure Anal- ysis includes assumptions regarding the manner in which the eustatic  (the total volume of ocean water) and vertical changes in sea levels  could affect a community.Adaptation Planning Guidebook | 31 30 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook The Statewide Vulnerability Assessment Report (2014)10 recommends  utilizing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change  Curve Calculator coupled with static point projection of inundation.  Because point projection also generates attribute files, an accompa- nying table can be created that indicates sea level rise over the given  time period (i.e., rise amount of each project year). FDOTs Sea Level  Rise Scenario Sketch Planning Tool website includes an add-in download  that calculates sea level rise in GIS software utilizing the USACE method.  This recommendation may mean that coastal sea level rise will be pro- jected along seven delineations that reflect the seven FDOT districts. For  the planning horizon years, the report recommends that model years of  2020, 2040, 2060, 2080, and 2100 be projected to establish continuity  with the FDOT tool.

A  Sensitivity Analysis is also important to include in a Vulnerability Anal- ysis because it can answer the question: who and what will be affected  by potential sea level rise? For such an analysis, additional GIS data  layers are needed to assess where the projected inundation is likely to  affect structures, populations, conservation areas, and other entities. The Statewide Vulnerability Assessment Report (2014)11 recommends  pairing or overlaying the Exposure Analysis model outputs (i.e., GIS  data layer of coastal inundation) with all entities identified in the table  below to determine which entities are sensitive to sea level rise. This  list was compiled from two sensitivity analyses created by the South- east Florida Regional Climate Change Compact (2012)12 and Climate  Central (2014).13", "286": "Focus Areas Once the Exposure and Sensitivity Analyses have been conducted, a  community may translate these findings into map-designated areas  that constitute the boundaries of the Focus Areas. Focus Areas should  be based upon the findings generated during the Exposure and Sensi- tivity Analyses. Focus Areas can be defined on a map according to the  following characteristics: a specific geographic area (e.g., development  along coastlines), certain vulnerable populations or communities (e.g.,  the elderly and climate-related health risks), natural and built systems  (e.g., local stormwater drainage systems and infrastructure), and other  assets identified and quantified during the Sensitivity Analysis.", "287": "Funding Opportunities In addition to potential grants available through NOAA and other fed- eral and non-profit agencies (see Appendix 6.2 for examples of specific  funding programs), funding opportunities to complete a vulnerabil- ity assessment may come in the form of partnerships. A vulnerabil- ity assessment can support many local planning efforts in addition to  adaptation planning. As such, resources could be shared to support  the development of a vulnerability assessment that could be inte- grated into multiple local plans. Integrating adaptation planning into  existing local plans is discussed further, in Chapter 3.4.", "288": "2.6. Public Outreach Approach,  Communicating Risk, and Opportunities for  Community Participation Assigning the Focus Areas is an opportunity to conduct public outreach  and seek community participation in the Vulnerability Assessment  component as discussed in Chapter 2.3. The Vulnerability Analysis  public outreach, including sharing the results of the Exposure and Sen- sitivity Analyses, is an excellent forum to inform the public and stake- holders about the future risk of sea level rise and potential increased  flooding. It also provides a basis for the next round of meetings which  includes identifying mitigation strategies to address the vulnerability  (see Chapter 3).  The public should be given the chance to provide input about what  should become Focus Areas for the community. Information about  the potential encroachment of the sea into land areas and the entities  affected by a rise should be conveyed to the public during a workshop  or public meeting. Based on the feedback received from the public,  preferential areas can be determined that may be deemed Focus  Areas. The completion of this round of public outreach sets the stage  of who will be affected and to what degree to set up the adaptation  strategies.", "289": "3.1. Assess Adaptive Capacities Adaptive capacity has been defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change as the ability of a system to adjust to climate change  (including climate variability and extremes), to moderate potential  damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the  consequences. To assess community adaptive capacity, the planning  team and steering committee are encouraged to develop a framework  to evaluate the communitys capacity to address the impacts of sea  level rise. This may include, but is not limited to, an assessment of:15 1. Regulatory and planning capabilities (e.g., protection of human  life, development and redevelopment restrictions, coastal  management regulations, hazard mitigation, sustainability,  shoreline management, post-disaster recovery/emergency  plans, infrastructure placement, and financial impacts); 2. Administrative and technical capabilities (e.g., the number of  sea level rise experts, planners, engineers, GIS and mapping  resources, and modeling capabilities); 3. Fiscal capacity (e.g., taxes, bonds, grants, impact fees, with- holding spending in hazard zones, and insurance); and 4. Infrastructure (e.g., flood and erosion control structures, evac- uation routes and redundant water, wastewater, and power  systems).", "290": "3.2. Prioritize Adaptation Needs Once the adaptive capacities of the local community have been identi- fied, a prioritization framework can follow. At this point in the planning  process, the community should be aware of the impacts of potential  sea level rise and inland flooding, have identified its focus areas to  address the impacts, and/or have inventoried the capacity of the com- munity to adapt. It is at this step that the community combines those  findings and creates a short list of its biggest challenges to determine  what can feasibly be done where and when.16 Articulating a communitys biggest challenges to sea level rise is a nec- essary step in identifying adaptation needs. For example: The most  important challenge facing the local agency is adequately address- ing the current state of the wastewater treatment plant which is at  increased risk to flooding or Elevating the many bridges in the local  agencys jurisdiction to withstand 2 feet of sea level rise is our high- est priority. Prioritizing adaptation needs sets the stage for the next  sub-component  creating specific adaptation strategies. Prioritization can be as simple as selecting the needs that can be  addressed currently (using capacities already identified as robust in the  Assess Adaptive Capacity step or categorized as low-hanging fruit)  and saving the more involved solutions for later. Conversely, it may  be more important for a local agency to tackle large-scale expected  impacts first, regardless of cost and complication, due to urgency", "291": "3.3. Identify Adaptation Strategies  Once major needs and priorities are defined, specific adaptation strat- egies can be developed, vetted, and defined. It is very important to  note that many options are available when an area is projected to be  flooded, either permanently or intermittently. A community can select  from a wide range of adaptation strategies in the following categories:  Protection, Accommodation, Retreat, and Avoidance. ", "292": "Protection strategies involve both hard and soft (or gray and  green) structurally defensive measures to mitigate impacts of rising  seas while leaving the vulnerable structures behind these measures  largely unaltered. Seawalls, revetments, and levees are examples of  hard or gray protection strategies, while beach nourishment, oyster  reef restoration, and living shorelines are all examples of green protec- tion strategies.", "293": "Accommodation strategies alter physical design to allow the structure  or land use to stay in place. Examples of this are floodable develop- ment, floating structures, and increased stormwater storage via imple- mentation of Low Impact Development or Green infrastructure (LID/ GI) in upstream locations. LID/GI upstream improvements reduce  downstream flows by allowing more stormwater to infiltrate in place,  thereby taking the pressure off the existing downstream stormwater  infrastructure. In the Netherlands, a concept known as Room for the  River helps dictate land use compatible with periodic flooding being  designated adjacent to all major Dutch rivers.  ", "294": "Retreat from areas or infrastructure where protection or accommoda- tion will not be efficient or effective can be voluntary, incentivized, or  done gradually. It can also involve new building designs in vulnerable  areas to be altered or moved when appropriate in the future. Com- munities can also plan for an eventual retreat from barrier islands and  coastal high hazard areas but, in the meantime, continue to invest  in assets in a limited fashion based on that assets expected lifetime  and projected inundation. It is important to note that communication  about retreat can be difficult. The language used to convey adaptation  strategies can make a difference in how communities react to propos- als. The term retreat often conveys a defeat, which can deter stake- holders from embracing the strategy. They may instead fight it. Other  possible terms to use include managed relocation and realign- ment. Home buyout programs, rolling easements, and land swaps are  a few possible mechanisms that communities can investigate in order  to implement managed retreat. There is also a growing body of case  law in this arena.", "295": "Avoidance involves guiding new development away from areas that  are subject to coastal hazards and can be done by implementing pol- icy and/or offering of incentives. Since capital infrastructure is devel- oped and maintained for a relatively long lifespan, planning for future  changes in sea level should be a part of initial design or incorporated  when plans are due for periodic update. City and County Land Devel- opment Regulations and Codes, as well as zoning regulations, can be  used to direct development and redevelopment to more suitable areas  where flooding and erosion are less troublesome. See Chapter 3.6 for  information about Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), another  strategy for avoidance.", "296": "Adaptation Action Areas  a State Planning Tool The designation of Adaptation  Action Areas (AAAs) is a compre- hensive planning tool that has been  available since 2011 with the pas- sage of the Community Planning  Act by the Florida legislature. An  optional but highly recommended  tool for adaptation strategies, AAAs  lend themselves to a flexible form  of zoning overlay that delineates  the physical areas where certain measures, restrictions, or prioritized  funding would apply. It is especially beneficial to designate AAAs now  because local agencies currently have the option to devise criteria  for their designation and the flexibility to edit them as circumstances  change. In many instances the 2018 FIRM update expands FEMA-des- ignated floodplains, however, in places where they are being reduced,  the need for AAAs is especially urgent. These areas are still vulnerable  to flooding, but property owners who have the option to drop flood  insurance will likely do so", "297": "Adaptation  Action Areas (AAAs)", "298": "Selection of Strategies In coordination with public input (which is described in greater detail in  Chapter 3.7), the planning team assesses the relative merits and costs  of each adaptation strategy within a given focus area to prioritize the  preferred adaptation strategy. This may be accomplished through a ben- efit-cost analysis, alternatives analysis, stakeholder feedback, or even  new output from a tool utilized during the Vulnerability Assessment.  Communities that have already gone through this process have also  identified the value of doing a business as usual baseline assessment18 that will help compare the costs anticipated by the adaptation strategies.  While adaptation strategies carry a cost, sometimes a significant one,  in the long run a benefit-cost analysis may show that properly planned  adaptation yields a tremendous savings as compared to doing nothing.", "299": "3.4. Integrate into Existing Plans Adaptation Planning outcomes are very effective when integrated into  specific local planning products. Below is a list of eight planning prod- ucts that may already exist in a local community that are appropriate  to amend with adaptation planning strategies.19 A Local Comprehensive Plan (LCP) is required of all Florida counties  and municipalities, guiding future growth and development. LCP pol- icies generally influence a communitys day-to-day land use decisions  and capital facilities expenditures. These policies play a major role in  determining local development patterns, which in turn determine the  degree to which people and property are exposed to natural hazards,  injury, and damage. Examples of communities who have already incor- porated AAAs in their LCP are included in Chapter 3.6, Best Practices. Florida local agencies are now required to integrate or add accom- modations for the 2015 Peril of Flood Statute [163.3178(2)(f) 1-6]  into their Local Comprehensive Plan. Signed into law by Governor Rick  Scott on May 21, 2015, this requirement should be contained in a new  or existing redevelopment component of their coastal management  planning element. This component should eliminate inappropriate and  unsafe development in the coastal areas when opportunities arise.", "300": "Much of the data analysis and mapping performed for a robust  response to the Peril of Flood requirement can also contribute to a  Vulnerability Assessment. The Local Mitigation Strategy (LMS) is usually developed at the county  level and serves to reduce the risks associated with natural and man- made disasters, including sea level rise. It is a connection between the  Local Comprehensive Plan, the emergency management plan, the cap- ital improvements plan, land development regulations, building codes,  and key ordinances such as those for floodplain management.  A Special Area Management Plan (SAMP) is a broad-reaching plan  providing for natural resource protection and reasonable coastal-de- pendent economic growth and contains a detailed and comprehensive  statement of policies, standards, and criteria to guide public and pri- vate uses of lands and waters as well as mechanisms for timely imple- mentation in specific geographic areas within the coastal zone. SAMPs  also provide for increased specificity in protecting natural resources,  improved protection of life and property in hazardous areas, including  those areas likely to be affected by sea level rise, as well as improved  predictability in government decision making. 16 USCS  1453 (17),  [Title 16. Conservation; Chapter 33. Coastal Zone Management]. An Economic Development Plan (EDP) provides an overview of the  economy, sets policy direction for economic growth, and identifies strat- egies, programs, and projects for improvement. These policies and strat- egies can guide future investment and economic growth or activities to  areas that are safe and that have reduced exposure to hazard risks. 20 Peril of Flood Statute. SB 1094, 2015. Florida 163.3178(2)(f) 1-6. Adaptation Planning Guidebook | 43 42 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook A post-disaster redevelopment plan (PDRP) is encouraged for all com- munities. A PDRP identifies policies, operational strategies, and roles  and responsibilities for implementation that will guide decisions that  affect long-term recovery and redevelopment of a community after a  disaster. PDRPs emphasize seizing opportunities for hazard mitigation  and community improvement consistent with the goals of the Local  Comprehensive Plan and with full participation of the citizens.  A capital improvements plan (CIP) guides the scheduling of spending  on public improvements, such as capital projects and equipment pur- chases. A CIP can serve as an important mechanism for guiding future  investments and improvements away from identified hazard areas. It  can be used to modify an existing project to add a mitigation/resilience  component. A stormwater management plan (SMP) is designed to address flood- ing associated with stormwater runoff. A stormwater management  plan is typically focused on design and construction measures that are  intended to reduce the impact of more frequently occurring but minor  (from a flooding standpoint) urban flooding that impacts water quality. A historic preservation plan (HPP) is intended to preserve historic  structures or districts within a community. An often-overlooked aspect  of the historic preservation plan is the assessment of buildings and  sites located in areas subject to natural hazards and the identification  of ways to reduce future damages.", "301": "FDOT Sea Level Scenario Sketch Planning Tool", "302": "The Nature Conservancy Coastal Resilience Mapping  Portal", "303": "NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Land  Cover Atlas and Coastal Comparison Tool", "304": "Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI)", "305": "USGS National Assessment of Coastal Vulnerability to  Sea Level Rise: Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI)*", "306": "USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS)", "307": "ADvanced CIRCulaton Model (ADCIRC)", "308": "Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and  Tradeoffs (InVEST)", "309": "NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI)", "310": "Sea Levels Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM)", "311": "Simulator of Climate Change Risks and Adaptation  Initiatives (SimCLIM)", "312": "USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator", "313": "Coastal Adaptation to Sea Level Rise Tool (COAST)", "314": "U.S. DOT Vulnerability Assessment Scoring Tool (VAST)", "315": "Adaptation Database for Planning Tool (ADAPT)", "316": "Climate Adaptation Knowledge Exchange (CAKE)", "317": "Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) Tools Network  and Database", "318": "FL DEP Map Direct Gateway", "319": "Florida Natural Areas Inventory (FNAI)", "320": "Geospatial Assessment Tool for Operations and  Response (GATOR)", "321": "U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit", "322": "Floridas GeoPlan Sketch  Tool ", "323": "NOAAs Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper", "324": " Sea Level Rise  Viewer", "325": "Blue Marble Geographics Coastal Adaptation to  Sea Level Rise Tool", "326": "Funding Opportunities Funding opportunities to complete adaptation planning or projects  can come from a variety of sources.

Public Outreach Approach and  Opportunities for Community Participation The Adaptation Strategies step is the most solution-based part of the  Adaptation Planning process. An extensive public involvement component  is appropriate for this point and should build off the findings of the Vulner- ability Assessment. Unique local solutions are only possible when people  with different expertise and interests come together and collaborate. Structured discussion will help guide collaboration and keep the con- versation on task and productive. It is possible to delve into great  depth on particular issues and this type of detail is not always appro- priate in settings with large numbers of attendees. Questionnaires sent  to participants before the workshops that ask about their goals and  expectations for the workshop can be especially helpful as is a second  questionnaire sent after the workshop to ask participants about how  they would like to make use of the Adaptation Plan in their respective  departments.23 As learned during the pilot community projects, local officials want  to better understand their options and constraints. Knowing both the  local context as well as what has been done in other parts of Florida will  enable local officials to make informed decisions. Information pertaining  to both is appropriate to include in public materials and discussions.", "328": "Once a set of adaptation strategies has been developed and analyzed, it  is time to transition to implementation activities to move the strategies  from plan to action. This process includes identifying, preparing for, and  applying for potential funding opportunities; creating a schedule of adap- tation actions for the future; and monitoring and evaluating progress. Implementation strategies are the specific steps a community takes to  incorporate the adaptation strategies into existing planning, budgeting,  and staffing mechanisms. The Assess Adaptive Capacities sub-com- ponent (Chapter 3.1) should outline the ability of the community to  take action. Even before the Vulnerability Assessment is conducted,  communities may want to consider possible implementation strate- gies based on available capacities, existing implementation schedules,  or available funding sources. Communities must be able to support  and implement adaptation activities to successfully reduce the neg- ative impacts of potential sea level rise that were identified during a  Vulnerability Assessment. The ability to implement can increase over  time, so communities should not simply settle for what is available at  the current time but expect that, as they undertake the first round of  implementation, their knowledge and capacity will grow. The Implementation Strategies component contains most of the adap- tation plans logistics  the actions and functions that need to take  place for the product (adaptation strategies) to be delivered.

Survey of Funding Options  It is recommended that a systematic review of all known funding  sources, as well as inquiry into new funding opportunities that may  facilitate a successful implementation strategy, be completed. The availability of funds is often a key determinant as to what activi- ties could be undertaken. Funding can originate at non-profit, private,  local, state, and federal levels. It may originate from a source such  as penny sales tax, tax-increment financing, cooperative banking, or  grants. Available grants often change, but the following list identifies  agencies that may offer grants to fund adaptation strategies as well as  past and current grant examples:   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  Office  for Coastal Management Broad Agency Announcement for  special projects   US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  P3 awards: A national  student design competition for sustainability   US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)   Community Development Block Grants Chapter 4: Implementation Strategies52 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook   Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)  Florida  Coastal Partnership Initiative   Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO)  Community  Resiliency Technical Assistance Grants   Local land conservation trusts (such as the Florida Keys Environ- mental Restoration Trust Fund) The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may also pro- vide several kinds of assistance to communities who have prepared  a local mitigation strategy that conforms to the standards set forth  in the Code of Federal Regulations (44 CR 201.6). If the community  has developed a hazard mitigation plan that is recognized by the State  (under Section 322 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer- gency Act as amended April 2013), then some examples of applicable  FEMA funding that can be applied to coastal Protection, Accommoda- tion, and Retreat measures are as follows:   Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)   Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM)   Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) FEMA makes the Hazard Mitigation Assistance guidance, which pro- vides the detailed information on these mitigation grant programs,  available annually. In some instances, funding can be obtained to assist  with the Vulnerability Assessment component also. Hazard Mitigation  Plans (known locally in Florida as the Local Mitigation Strategy or LMS),  which can be funded under HMGP and PDM, can also include Avoid- ance measures.", "330": "After major disasters, the Department of Housing and Urban Develop- ment (HUD) can provide mitigation grants under its Community Devel- opment Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program when  Congress approves a disaster supplemental. The eligible activities vary  from disaster to disaster and would be provided in the Federal Register  notice along with the State Action Plan that must be developed. In addition, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), under  the US Department of Agriculture, has two programs that may be  available to communities: the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP)  Program and the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention (WFPO)  Program. The EWP Program is a federal emergency recovery program  available after disasters and offers assistance to communities to relieve  imminent threats to life and property caused by natural disasters that  impair a watershed. The WFPO is a cooperative program between the  federal government, states, and locals to prevent floodwater and sed- iment damage and erosion and work towards conservation of water  and land in authorized watersheds. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity manages the Flor- ida Disaster Recovery Program and assists communities in develop- ing economic development strategies, meeting the requirements of  the Community Planning Act, addressing critical local planning issues,  and promoting innovative planning solutions to challenges identified  by local government applicants.

Deliverables must be approved by the Bureau befor", "331": "money is disbursed. The grants provide communities the opportunity  to develop innovative planning and development strategies to pro- mote a diverse economy, create vibrant rural and suburban areas,  and meet the requirements of the Community Planning Act while pro- tecting environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, the community  is encouraged to brainstorm innovative local funding ideas and plan  activities to build awareness and capacity for self-directed programs. If  a community identifies a lack of funding, a key consideration in assess- ing management priorities may be to identify and develop additional  funding resources", "332": "4.1.1. Prioritize Strategies Once a community has identi- fied Protection, Accommodation,  Retreat, and Avoidance strategies,  it may prioritize actions within its  Focus Areas. Funding should be  prioritized for adaptation activ- ities and actions, reducing risk  in the most cost-efficient way. It is important to maintain a balance  between the urgency of the moment to address current risks while  showing foresight to plan for future impacts. In several instances, it is a  minimal cost to add an additional safety margin to a project which will  also help maintain the projects effectiveness as vulnerability and risk  may increase over time. Keep in mind that many facilities and infra- structure are built to last 30 to 50 years, if not longer, and future risk  Different types of prioritization  reflect where the urgency is,  community acceptance, and  what can get the biggest bang  for the buck. It is better to  establish the criteria upfront. Chapter 4: Implementation Strategies54 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook in the latter stages of developments useful life should be factored.  Consideration of all possible options and the related costs and benefits  of each will allow for a no-regrets strategy to be designed. Priorities should be based on risks identified and potential losses as  a result of those risks and reviewed in relation to funding, ability to  implement, and consistency with other plans. FEMA and NOAA (2013)  have developed a comprehensive but quick checklist of considerations  known as STAPLEE that help evaluate each proposed action:24   Social  What are the socially acceptable adaptation strategies in  the community?   Technical  What are the technically feasible adaptation strategies  within the community?   Administrative  Which adaptation strategies are implementable  by community leadership?   Political  Which adaptation strategies are politically acceptable  within the community?   Legal  Which adaptation strategies are legally implementable by  the community under state and municipal law?   Economic  What are the cost-effective adaptation strategies avail- able to the community?   Environmental  Which adaptation strategies are most favorable  to the environment as determined by community conservation  plans and statewide guidance? By using the STAPLEE categories, a community may prioritize adapta- tion strategies that meet local capacity and preferences. The STAPLEE  method can evaluate costs in relation to benefits of implementing  one particular action over another. Using STAPLEE serves as a reality  check that helps communities avoid putting too much effort into a  type of action that has little chance of success due its particular cir- cumstances, preferences, history, and culture. An informal cost-benefit analysis can also be used to review proposed  adaptation actions. Ratings of high, medium, or low can be assigned  to the anticipated costs and the benefits associated with each action  based on general criteria that are established by the community.  Examples of ratings could include criteria such as:    High cost  existing funding is not adequate.    Medium cost  existing funding would require budget reapportionment  or amendment.   Low cost  funding available under existing budget.   High benefit  action would have a significant impact on risk reduction.   Medium benefit  action would have an impact on risk reduction.   Low benefit  long-term benefits are difficult to quantify in short term.", "333": "This methodology provides a framework for the  overall costs and benefits of each action to be con- sidered when setting priorities. As described in  Chapter 3, there are situations where the impacts  from sea level rise are significant and already  present or imminent that may warrant taking on  the bigger challenges in the near term even if all  the funding needed is not presently identified.  Prioritization enhances the impact of Focus Area- driven adaptation strategies by ensuring that  the community adds additional aspects to the  comprehension of coastal flooding in the greater  context and functioning of the community.", "334": "4.2. Create a Schedule of Activities, Actions,  and Actors Creating a Schedule of Activities, Actions, and Actors takes the sec- ond half of implementation into account  providing impetus to the  actions to be completed and the agency/department/staff responsi- ble for each action. This sub-component can serve to program differ- ent types of adaptation activities according to their prioritized need  (see Chapters 3.2 and 4.1.1) and, in pairing with funding opportunities,  generate a concise and easy-to-follow plan. To create a schedule that is flexible yet delegates responsibility, the  planning team should identify the appropriate responsible party who  has the ability to complete a task, activity, or strategy.25 The plan- ning team may then schedule their monitoring and evaluation (see  Chapter 4.3) to follow up with the responsible local staff member.  Scheduling transfers responsibility to the implementing entity to  set and maintain timelines while ensuring that a coordinating group  remains informed and responsive to the activity as it is carried out  and later evaluated. However, due to the multi-disciplinary approach  needed to undertake many adaptation measures, it is recommended  that support personnel be assigned to projects to assist the primary  with the additional skill sets, knowledge base, and contacts needed to  successfully implement a project. Scheduling activities and assigning staff may emphasize the util- ity of planning ahead as the various elements of the schedule come  online. By naming the person or group responsible for each activitys  implementation, more accurate timelines can be made which may  economize the implementation process. As discussed in Chapter 3.4,  integrating adaptation into existing plans, if the strategy involves incor- porating activities into a regulatory document, provides an opportu- nity to program capacity building measures. For this sub-component,  the planning team is encouraged to consider consultants outside of  local government staff. A diverse set of participants within the steering  committee could connect individuals or entities from a wide berth in  the private sector, non-profits, and universities.", "335": "4.3. Monitor and Evaluate In order to ensure that adaptation  strategies continue to serve their  intended purpose  to robustly  respond to the community priori- tized sea level rise vulnerabilities   it is recommended that an adapta- tion plan include a Monitoring and  Evaluation component. Monitoring  and Evaluation extends throughout  the horizon of the plans implemen- tation, which could extend for many  years. The ability to communicate  the guiding goals of the plan across iterations of implementing manag- ers is essential. This is done through a Monitoring and Evaluation plan  that uses consistent criteria, such as indicators that can be tracked  throughout the implementation horizon, and rated by different imple- menting managers. For this sub component, the planning team is encouraged to use indi- ces or performance indicators to easily determine if an adaptation  strategy is performing adequately. For example, point values could be  assigned based on various levels or percentages of project completion  to measure the progress towards completion, or project benchmarks  or major milestones could be established to track accomplishments  and project status. Monitoring of the adaptation strategies is a check-in to see that strate- gies are being carried out as anticipated and intended. This can include  review of successful actions identified and implemented, review of  barriers or obstacles to implementation for strategies that were iden- tified but not completed, need for revisions to activities based on  review, and reevaluation of proposed timelines based on new informa- tion on impacts and funding. Once the progress attained is evaluated,  activities can be revised where needed to make certain the adaptation  plan goals are being achieved. Revisions and updates of the strategies  can also consider potential changes in hazard vulnerability, local capa- bilities and resources, and risk reduction priorities. Lessons learned  during the implementation should be shared across the community  and even with other communities to expand the knowledge base of  what is working, what would work better with some modifications,  and the pitfalls to avoid. In addition to monitoring activities, it is important to revisit the data  and methodologies that go into the Vulnerability Assessment. Of these,  the sea level rise projection model may be one of the most important  aspects of an adaptation plan to monitor. Over an example horizon of  five years, global climate models and viewing tools may increase their  accuracy and level of representation. The planning team can respond to  this by incorporating model update results into new iterations of their  adaptation plan. For example, new projection model updates could  project a faster or slower rate of sea level rise, and therefore, the plan- ning horizon and timelines for implementation of adaptation activities  may be adjusted to reflect the updated or best available information. Monitoring and Evaluation  should be approached with  an Adaptive Management  mindset to constantly strive  to improve the approach as  lessons learned are obtained  and new data is available. This  sustained effort helps keep the  planning process viable over  many years and should help  build momentum to adapt to  the changing environment.Adaptation Planning Guidebook | 59 58 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook Post-disaster evaluation efforts  are a productive combination  with adaptation monitoring and  updates. Moreover, if a commu- nity experiences a disaster event,  more attention will shift toward  adaptation efforts, and higher inci- dences of buy-in for certain adap- tation activities may arise. Partic- ularly, larger-scale disaster events  could greatly accelerate the imple- mentation schedule. Therefore,  the schedule of activities can be  changed to reflect new timelines  for more robust measures.", "336": "4.5. Public Outreach Approach and  Opportunities for Community Participation Outreach can be one of the most important activities within a program  because it can lead to municipal action in the future. Increased stake- holder engagement throughout the adaptation planning process can  help to create buy-in amongst the public which can then in turn lead  to greater political support for adaptation actions in the community.  Holding public meetings, forums, or workshops that include business  groups, residents, and other community stakeholders can provide an  opportunity to educate participants and receive feedback based on  their understanding of local vulnerabilities to sea level rise and poten- tial responses. It can also be used as an opportunity to establish a con- nection between incremental improvements to citizen and property  safety and welfare and a more desirable future community. Participatory monitoring efforts can help the community observe  unanticipated coastal flooding impacts and effects of adaptation strat- egies. Stakeholder feedback can be used to gauge community satisfac- tion with adaptation strategies and their implementation and provide  a forum for addressing new concerns as they arise. These two partic- ipatory activities will continue after the initial planning effort is com- plete and may be integrated with other ongoing monitoring and evalu- ation mechanisms to ensure that continued attention is paid to them.  Communities should establish a long-term, simple feedback mecha- nism whereby individuals may express new concerns or developments  about the selected adaptation projects. In addition, some adaptation  projects (usually environmental) involve a degree of monitoring. Com- munity members may be willing to volunteer their time to observe if  the desired effects are occurring and even to provide maintenance and  upkeep labor.", "337": "Resilience has many definitions, but in the context of this guidebook,  it means the ability of a community to prepare for and adapt to the  effects of sea level rise, especially coastal flooding, erosion, and eco- system changes.

This  chapter, Chapter 1, introduced the guide, its purpose,  intended audience, methodology, and structure. The  remainder of the guide is organized as follows:  Chapter 2 Climate Change and the Coast provides a brief and general overview of the  value of our coasts and how they may be  affected by climate change to establish the  importance of adaptation planning.   Chapter 3 Planning Process describes the  steps to take to create a plan and bring it to  life.  Chapter 4 Vulnerability Assessment explains the elements involved in a  vulnerability assessment for the purposes of  guiding adaptation efforts.  Chapter 5 Adaptation Strategy discusses  how to establish goals and identify actions  that may be able to reduce the negative  impacts associated with climate change and  introduces a framework to help users choose  and prioritize actions that will aid them in  achieving their goals.  Chapter 6 Plan Implementation and  Maintenance suggests ways to implement  a plan; track, evaluate, and communicate its  progress; and update it to reflect completed  actions, changing circumstances, and new  science, data, tools, and techniques.

Appendix B Federal Laws and Executive  Orders Relevant to Climate Change on  the Coast lists some of the federal laws and  executive orders that support climate change  adaptation.  Appendix C Regional Climate Summaries  provides brief summaries of how climate  change may affect the different regions of the  United States.", "343": "The Value of Our Coasts Our coasts are critically important to our nation,  supporting a large percentage of its population as well  as its economy. In 2007, According to the National  Ocean Economics Program (NOEP), the coastal  zone was home to an estimated 127 million people,  supported 57 million jobs, and contributed $6.7 trillion  to the U.S. economy, accounting for 42 percent of  the U.S. population and 49 percent of its national  economic output (NOEP 2009a).  In its 2009 State of the U.S. Ocean and Coastal Economies  report, the NOEP provided a snapshot of the 6 A Planning Guide for State Coastal Managers ocean economy. The ocean economy consists  of economic activities that are tied to the ocean or  Great Lakes, or that are partially related to the ocean  or Great Lakes, and are located in a shore-adjacent  zip code. In 2004 (the most recent year for which  the information is available), the ocean economy  contributed $138 billion to the U.S. economy:  Tourism and recreation: $70 billion  Marine transportation: $28 billion  Offshore minerals: $20 billion  Ship and boat building: $11 billion  Living resources: $7 billion  Marine construction: $3 billion Measuring the ocean economy is complicated, and  data are limited. In order to make data compatible and  comparable across all six sectors, some sector data  were excluded in the NOEP study. Sector-specific  reports from other sources, which use different  definitions, methodologies, and parameters, can  provide greater detail. For example, NOAAs National  Marine Fisheries Service reported that the commercial  fishing industry generated over $103 billion in sales  and $44 billion in income in 2006. That same year,  recreational fishing contributed $82 million in sales  (largely in durable equipment) to the U.S. economy  and generated $38 billion in value-added impacts  (NOAA n.d. Fisheries). The coasts also provide a number of services that do  not have traditional market values but in total may  be even more valuable than those that do. The value  of coastal wetlands, for example, has been estimated  to be between $3 and 13 million per km2 (Knogge  et al. 2004). And, additional research suggests that  the storm protection services they provide are worth  $23.2 billion annually (Costanza et al. 2008). The total  nonmarket value for U.S. coastal and ocean resources  is at minimum tens of billions of dollars per year  and likely much more (NOEP 2009b). According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,  coastal ecosystemscoastal lands, areas where  fresh water and salt water mix, and nearshore  marine areasare among the most productive yet  highly threatened systems in the world. These  ecosystems produce disproportionately more  services relating to human well-being than most  other systems (Hassan et al. 2005). Some of the  nonmarket services provided by coastal ecosystems  (e.g., estuaries, marshes, coral reefs, mangroves,  lagoons, salt ponds, seagrass) include flood and  storm protection, erosion control, water quality  maintenance, biological productivity, fish and  wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and  aesthetic value", "344": "Impacts and Consequences of  Climate Change on the Coast Our nations coasts are particularly susceptible  to climate change. They are already subject to  an array of social and environmental stressors  that have resulted in habitat loss and conversion,  habitat degradation, and overexploitation. Key  stressors include coastal development, storms  and other natural processes (e.g., erosion  and subsidence), deforestation, pollution,  invasive species, unsustainable and destructive  fishing practices, recreational activities, energy  development, etc. Climate change, defined by  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) as any change in climate over time,  whether due to natural variability or as result of  human activity, will exacerbate these stressors  (IPCC 2007a). Implications are expected to be far  reaching for coastal communities, economies, and  ecosystems (Karl et al. 2009).  Since 1900, the global average surface temperature  of the Earth has risen by about 1.5F (Karl et al.  2009). And, the 2000s decade (2000-09) was the  warmest on record, with 9 of its 10 years (2001- 09) ranking among the top 10 warmest years on  record (NOAA 2010a). Significantly, it was the  global warming that occurred over the last 50 years  that accounts for the majority of the increase,  which is largely attributable to human activities (i.e.,  greenhouse gas emissions). In the United States, the  average temperature has risen more than 2F over  the last 50 years (Karl et al. 2009). ", "345": "The IPCC has projected a likely rise in the average  global surface temperature of an additional 2 to 11.5F  by 2100 (relative to the 1980-99 time period) based on  an assumption of no changes in climate policy. In the  United States, the average temperature is projected to  increase by approximately 7 to 11F under a higher  emissions scenario and by approximately 4 to 6.5F  under a lower emissions scenario (Karl et al. 2009).  In addition to increases in air temperature, there is  evidence that other associated changes are taking place.  Some of these climate change phenomena, which are  discussed throughout this guide, include rising sea levels,  declining Great Lake levels, increasing storm intensity/ frequency (tropical and cold-season storms), changing  precipitation patterns, increasing water temperature, and  ocean acidification. The effects of these changes are  being observed across all sectors in the United States and  around the world (Karl et al. 2009).  Our understanding of the effects of climate change  on the United States is still evolving. According to the  U.S. Global Change Research Program, future changes  in some phenomena are more difficult to project than  others (e.g., changes in precipitation are more difficult to  project than changes in temperature) (Karl et al. 2009).  A lot remains uncertain and depends on the success of  our efforts to mitigate climate change. Nevertheless,  despite the uncertainties, current climate change  projections are considered reliable enough to warrant  and support adaptation planning (Karl et al. 2009).  ", "346": "Ultimately, rising sea levels mean land and ecosystem  loss. Some degree of economic loss is inevitable. In  1991, the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) estimated that a one-foot rise in sea level by  2100 would increase annual flood damage to insured  property by 36-58 percent and a three-foot rise would  increase annual damage by 102-200 percent. Recent  estimates indicate that a sea level rise of nearly 20  Storm surge on a Louisiana highway shows the potential effects of  rising sea levels.13 Adapting to Climate Change  inches by 2100 would cause $23-170 billion in  damage to U.S. coastal property (Ruth et al. 2007).  In addition, as land and ecosystems are inundated,  associated cultural resources may also be lost,  especially where populations, both human and  otherwise, are forced to relocate.", "347": "In recent decades, coastal storms have accounted  for the majority of U.S. annual disaster losses (Heinz  Center 1999; NOAA 2010a). Thus, in coastal areas,  where real estate values may be very high, the potential  economic impacts of natural disasters, which will be  exacerbated by climate change, could be significant.  The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season caused damage and  incurred associated costs estimated at more than $50  billion. One year later, Hurricane Katrina alone cost  approximately $134 billion, becoming the costliest U.S.  storm on record (NOAA 2010a).

While  this guide is written for coastal managers at the state  level and focuses largely on activities for which they  have responsibilities, your state may want to address  adaptation at a larger scale. In that case, you may be  the lead, or you may be one of many planning team  members.  The process described in this guide can be scaled  up to incorporate impacts, consequences, and  sectors not discussed here (e.g., those not under the  jurisdiction of the coastal management program)  or can be scaled down to focus on a single impact,  consequence, or region. Conducted on its own, a  coastal adaptation plan could easily be integrated  into larger planning efforts, which may or may not  yet have begun.  Consider whether a stand-alone adaptation plan  is really necessary. What other ongoing planning", "350": "efforts is your state engaged in? Some states are  including climate change adaptation planning along  with climate change mitigation planning or in their  hazard mitigation plans, which may give short shrift to  ecological systems and needs. Others are including it in  wildlife action plans, which, in turn, will likely exclude  impacts on the built environment. Other plans that  may relate to climate change adaptation include coastal  management, watershed management, emergency  operations, transportation, economic development, and  growth plans. These plans are also excellent resources  for the adaptation plans vulnerability assessment and  adaptation strategy.  Know what your state is thinking about climate  change adaptation planning, both short and long  term, and where your program best fits into the  process. Also, look into how adaptation planning  is being handled at the local level in your state and  consider how to incorporate existing efforts into your  plan and/or how your plan can be used to guide and  support local planning. A new state law or executive order authorizing the  climate change adaptation planning process would  help ensure it has adequate resources, support, and  legitimacy. This may require educating elected officials,", "351": "which should be done early in the planning process.  See the discussion beginning on page 23 about  educating, engaging, and involving stakeholders.", "352": "Human resourcesThis category includes  anyone who will help with plan development  and implementation. This is a planning team  effort, as is described in the next step, and  responsibilities should be distributed across  participants and other stakeholders. By  engaging multiple agencies, sectors, and levels  of government, the plan will become less of  a burden on any one entity and will benefit  from access to more information and points of  view, as well as financial and technical resources  and greater acceptance and buy-in to the idea  of climate change adaptation and the climate  change adaptation plan.  ", "353": "Technical resourcesClimate change  adaptation planning and implementation will  require a lot of technical data and know-how.  Much of the expertise can be secured when  building the planning team. You will need  people who understand and track the science  as well as people who can take the science and  state-specific data and help decipher what it  may mean for your coastal areas. This will likely  require information technology ranging from  basic geographic information systems (GIS) to  sophisticated modeling programs. Understand  the limitations of your states computing  capacity before acquiring the latter. If you do  not have access to the technical expertise or  the necessary computing capacity, you may  want to consider contracting with a university,  consulting firm, or other technical partner.  Finally, you will likely need to involve social  scientists and technical experts (e.g., engineers,  biologists, geologists) when you identify and  implement adaptation actions.", "354": "Financial resourcesYou will need financial  resources to support both human and technical  resources as well as general planning activities  (e.g., public meeting notices, meeting space,  office supplies, etc.). A number of federal  agencies provide grants for planning and  implementation activities, most of which, at  this point in time, indirectly support climate  change adaptation.

Coordination and collaboration with  these entities is vital to the success of the adaptation  plan. You may prefer to conduct your vulnerability  assessment before you build the planning team, but  having the team in place first means more resources,  and likely better information, are available for the  assessment.

Who you invite to participate on the planning  team, and who you choose to involve in more of a  supporting role, will depend on state-specific needs  and circumstances. Nevertheless, involvement of  a diverse set of stakeholders will be critical to the  process. More information about how to involve  stakeholders, including the general public, who may  not be directly involved as part of the planning team,  is presented in the next section. Most of the state  and federal partners on the planning team will likely  already be aware of the need to adapt to climate  change impacts. If not, be sure to educate them as  you would other stakeholders as discussed in the next  step. Planning is a partnership- and consensus-building  exercise that requires a variety of skills and expertise.  It will allow coordination and integration of activities  across agencies, organizations, and jurisdictions,  capitalizing on human, technical, and financial  resources and avoiding unnecessary redundancies.  It should be an inclusive process that allows  diverse concerns to be addressed, considered, and  incorporated. And, it will also require creativity and  compromise. Your climate change adaptation planning team will  be responsible for overseeing, coordinating, and  advocating climate change adaptation from planning  through implementation and beyond. Ideally,  members of the planning team will be engaged in  climate change issues or be willing to become so, be  able to provide needed input to the process, and have  the support of their employers.  It may be necessary to have a formal invitation  process, which could include asking agency and  department heads (or other figures of authority)  to designate appropriate representatives to serve  on the planning team. This can help ensure the  representative has some level of authority to act on  behalf of the organization. Such a request could  be sent as a letter explaining the need for the plan,  the planning process, and the role of planning team  members, which could include:  Participating in planning meetings  Providing input and information for the  vulnerability assessment  Participating in goal setting  Identifying adaptation actions for the plan  Reviewing and commenting on plan drafts  Assisting with outreach activities   Monitoring implementation of activities  specific to their organizations  Contributing to plan review and updating  activities  Working to mainstream climate change  adaptation into other agency activities Your climate change adaptation planning team will  cross levels of government and sectors. Inclusion of  a wide variety of partners will result in a coast better  prepared for the impacts of climate change. As you  structure the planning team, some of the questions for  consideration include:  What entities engage in activities that might impact or stress coastal systems and activities  managed by the coastal management program?

These phenomena are:  Rising Sea Levels  Declining Great Lake Levels  Increasing Storm Intensity/Frequency  Changing Precipitation Patterns  Increasing Air Temperature   Increasing Water Temperature  Ocean Acidification Because of the strong regional variations in most of  these phenomena, and based on the scope of the  plan, the planning team will need to decide which  phenomena to include in its vulnerability assessment.  There are a number of resources available to help with  this decision and to provide input into other steps of  this assessment. The U.S. Global Climate Research  Programs Global Climate Change Impacts in the United  States, which contains information about potential  impacts by region and is the authoritative source on  climate change science and impacts in the United States,  provides a good starting point.

As data are collected  about natural resources, the planning team may want  to consider attributes of these systems that provide  a sense of how vulnerable they may be to climate  change and, thus, which systems may need the most  assistance preparing for and responding to climate  change.

To model climate change in your state, consider  1) using the results of the scenarios generated for  2100 for the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Report7 and adjusting global projections to account for local  conditions (e.g., add local subsidence projections  to global sea level rise projections) and to estimate  shorter-term projections or 2) downscaling global  climate data.

Other important factors include the availability of  financial, technical, and human resources and the  states acceptable level of impacts. Goals should  be clearly written, attainable, and measurable  (qualitatively or quantitatively).  After reviewing the vulnerability assessment  findings, a good starting point for goal setting is  to review goals established in other state plans/ programs (e.g., those for coastal management,  hazard mitigation2, emergency operations,  environmental preservation, economic development,  resource management, transportation, etc.).  Adaptation plans from other governments, state and  local, are also useful resources. Some of these plans  can be accessed online at http://collaborate.csc .noaa.gov/climateadaptation/.", "395": "Step 3.2: Identify Actions Since many of the impacts and consequences of  climate change are not new, simply exacerbated or  accelerated, actions to reduce them already exist and  are being implemented outside the context of climate  change. This chapter illustrates how familiar actions  can also be used to support climate change adaptation. However, some of these actions are likely insufficient  for addressing the scale of the potential changes. It  will take a combination of existing, reconfigured, and  new actions to meet the challenges of climate change.  Importantly, the potential impacts of climate change on  the coast should be considered in all related planning,  law and policy making, and investment activities.", "396": "While reviewing state plans for possible goals,  also look at the actions and consider the following  questions in regard to actions along the coast as well  as elsewhere in the watershed:  Are there any actions that directly address  climate change impacts along the coast?   Are there any actions that indirectly address  climate change impacts along the coast?  Are there any actions that could or should  be modified to help meet the goals of the  adaptation plan?   Are there any actions that are in direct conflict  with the goals of the adaptation plan? To ensure the plan is inclusive of all actions that  may affect your coast and to avoid duplication, you  may want to consider incorporating ongoing and  already planned activities in your plan. Additionally,  there may be actions that could be modified to meet  multiple purposes with shared resources. If there are  actions that might hinder efforts to meet adaptation  goals, try to work with the entity responsible for that  action to reach a mutually beneficial solution. As  mentioned before, coordination and collaboration  among other state agencies and stakeholders is  critical, both to capitalize on each others efforts  and to avoid conflicts that could prove difficult and  expensive to overcome in the future. Think broadly and do not be afraid to think big. Do  not worry about resource or technology constraints,  these issues will be raised during the evaluation  process, which will help the planning team narrow  down the list and prioritize the agreed upon actions.  Hold on to the list of actions that do not make the  initial cut. In the future, some of these actions may be  more appropriate and/or feasible. Finally, be creative. Actions can be built to encompass one or more  measures (see examples in the table on page 51) and  should be crafted so they can be clearly understood  (e.g., does the action involve planning, promoting,  encouraging, mandating, constructing, etc.). While not  all of the measures included here can be implemented  at the state level, they are examples of activities states  can support and promote to local governments. A  lot of climate change adaptation will take place at the  local level, and financial and technical assistance from  higher levels of government, as well as mandates, in  some instances, will be vital to secure the necessary  level of local commitment. Not all actions included in this guide will be suitable  for every situation. One action may be appropriate  in one location but not in another. Suitability will  depend on circumstances specific to each state and its  ", "397": "coastal zone and may require additional research, study,  legal review, and legislative or regulatory change.  ", "398": "Planning, Law Making, and Regulating A number of measures can be used to alleviate many  of the impacts and consequences of climate change  and will be critical to successful climate change  adaptation efforts. Importantly, these measures include  planning, law making, and regulating. Adaptation  will require new, and modifications to existing, plans,  laws, and regulations. Going forward, all planning and  rulemaking activities should consider climate change  and future conditions so outcomes support, and do not  deter, adaptation efforts. Measures listed in the table on page 51 and discussed  further at the end of the chapter are more likely to be  acceptable and effective if they result from a traditional  planning process such as the one presented in this  guide. These measures can be incorporated into the  adaptation planning process or that of an existing plan  (e.g., comprehensive, hazard mitigation, watershed  management, capital improvement, etc.). Alternatively,  the planning team may decide a measure requires its  own plan (e.g., because of scope or complexity).  One type of plan encouraged by the Coastal Zone  Management Act is the Special Area Management  Plan (SAMP). SAMPs are broadly defined in the act  as plans which provide for increased specificity in  protecting significant natural resources, reasonable  coastal dependent economic growth, improved  protection of life and property in hazardous areas,  including those areas likely to be affected by land  subsidence, sea level rise, or fluctuating water levels  of the Great Lakes, and improved predictability in  governmental decision making (CZMA 1972). SAMPs  and other plans with similar intents are especially  appropriate in areas where authorities overlap and  coordination and cooperation is required to effectively  address the multitude of needs that have arisen along  the coasts. Many local governments, and some states, have  comprehensive plans to guide development. Some  states require local governments to have such plans;  others provide incentives that encourage them. In  ", "399": "either case, states typically specify the elements that  should be included in local comprehensive plans. For  the purposes of adaptation, a new adaptation element  could be specified, adaptation measures could be  incorporated into existing elements (e.g., land use,  transportation, environment, natural hazards, etc.),  as appropriate, or local adaptation plans could be  incorporated by reference. In addition, to address  climate change, the timeframe of comprehensive  plans may need to extend further into the future.  Incorporating adaptation into local comprehensive  plans in some way lends them the strength of internal  consistency, which is required by some states, to ensure  local actions are taken based upon and consistent with  the legally adopted comprehensive plan. Research on local comprehensive plans as vehicles  for reducing insured losses in natural disasters  suggests that comprehensive plans that include hazard  mitigation can reduce such losses: losses are lower  in states that require comprehensive plans and even  more so in those that require comprehensive plans  to address hazards. However, research also suggests  that in the absence of a state mandate to prepare a  comprehensive plan and address hazards, the planning  efforts of many local governments are inadequate  (Burby 2005). While mandates may result in plans, they may not  have the desired effect if they do not consider existing  barriers to effective planning and/or if the plans are  not effectively implemented.3 When issuing or revising  a state mandate, consider the role of the state in the  oversight process and how it can enforce and monitor  plan implementation as well as development and content  (while maintaining flexibility for local decision making). Since plans are typically not legally binding,  governments may pass laws and ordinances and issue  implementing regulations to best achieve the desired  outcomes identified through the planning process,  especially when it comes to land use. The Second  National Assessment on Natural and Related Technological  Hazards states No single approach to bringing  sustainable hazard mitigation into existence shows  more promise at this time than increased use of sound  and equitable land-use management (Mileti 1999).

In this task, the planning  team will decide which of the actions identified in  the previous step are actually suitable for the states  unique set of circumstances and then prioritize them  for implementation. Decisions will need to be made;  difficult tradeoffs may be required. Much of this  discussion is based on FEMAs Developing the Mitigation  Plan: Identifying Actions and Implementing Strategies (2003). One way to evaluate the proposed actions is to  use a method that considers the Social, Technical,  Administrative, Political, Legal, Economic, and  Environmental (STAPLEE) opportunities and  constraints of each action. The information the  planning team generates from this evaluation process  will help them weigh the pros and cons of each action  to determine which are best for the state. There are  no right or wrong answers. The criteria are defined as  follows:  SocialThe action should be socially  acceptable.   Will the proposed action  disproportionately affect (positively or  negatively) one segment of the population? Actions will need to be evaluated based on criteria established  by the planning team and, once selected, prioritized for  implementation.  Is the action compatible with present and  future community values?  TechnicalThe action should be technically  feasible, help to reduce losses in the long term,  and have minimal cumulative and secondary  impacts.   How effective is the action in avoiding or  reducing future losses?  Will it create more problems than it solves?  Does it solve the problem or only address a  symptom?  AdministrativeThe action should be  implementable by the state. Can the state meet  the staffing and funding needs of the action or  will it need outside assistance?   Does the state have the capacity (staff,  technical expertise, and funding) to  implement and maintain the action, or can  it be realistically obtained elsewhere?  PoliticalThe action should be politically  acceptable.   Is there political support to implement and  maintain this action?  Is there a champion willing to help see the  action to completion?  Is there enough public support to ensure  the success of the action?  LegalThe state must have the legal authority  to implement/enforce the action.   Does the state have the authority to  implement/enforce the action?  Are the proper laws and regulations in place  to implement/enforce the action?  Are there any potential legal consequences?  Will the state be liable for the action or lack  of action?  Is the action likely to be challenged by  stakeholders who may be negatively  affected?  EconomicThe action should be cost- effective and be likely to pass a benefit-cost  analysis.  Are there currently sources of funds that  can be used to implement the action?", "429": "What benefits (market and nonmarket)  will the action provide?  Does the cost seem reasonable for the  size of the problem and likely benefits?  What burden will be placed on the tax  base or local economy to implement this  action?  Does the action contribute to or detract  from other community economic  goals, such as capital improvements or  economic development?  What are the economic consequences of  not implementing the action?  EnvironmentalThe action should meet  statutory considerations and public desire  for sustainable and environmentally healthy  communities.  How will the action affect the  environment (land, water, protected  species)?  Will the action comply with state  and federal environmental laws and  regulations?  Is the action consistent with state  environmental goals? Once the planning team has decided on the  acceptable actions given review of the criteria above  (or a different set of criteria), it should prioritize the  actions for implementation.

In this guide, outreach  is the provision of information to all stakeholders  (anyone who will be affected by climate change  in your state), and education involves the formal  education system (typically kindergarten through  grade 12).  Purposes of outreach can include engaging  stakeholders in the planning effort, gaining support  for planning and action implementation, informing  the public about climate change and their role in  adaptation, communicating the benefits of natural  resources and ways to protect them, and changing  attitudes and behaviors. Outreach is not a one-time  activity. It should begin with the launching of the  adaptation planning effort and continue throughout  the process (as introduced in Chapter 3) and as  Using visuals to explain how coastal areas may be impacted  by climate change can build support for adaptation.  new information becomes available, milestones are  met, successes become evident, and whenever an  appropriate opportunity presents itself (e.g., when  the plan is released or when adaptation actions are  implemented that require support, adherence, or  assistance). There are numerous challenges to communicating  about climate change. The uncertainty of the  science and the presence of more immediate issues  are perhaps the biggest. While a few resources for  helping conduct outreach and craft and deliver  adaptation messages are noted at the end of the  chapter, the planning team should consider enlisting  communications specialists to help in this endeavor.  An outreach strategy can help guide climate change  adaptation communications and, similar to the  strategy for an adaptation plan, should identify goals  and actions to ensure stakeholders are being reached  in an effective manner. An outreach strategy involves  identifying the target population, conducting a  population profile (so the best way to communicate  with them is understood), crafting the message, and  then deciding how to disseminate it. There will likely  be multiple stakeholder groups/target populations  (e.g., planning team members and other participating  stakeholders, the general public, state and local elected  officials and other decision makers, developers,  resource managers, etc.) who may require tailored  messages and different delivery formats. ", "442": "As the strategy is drafted, the planning team should  consider what is already being done to reach the  target populations. Can climate change adaptation  be incorporated into existing government programs  for climate change mitigation, coastal management,  emergency management, public health, water  conservation, stormwater management, etc.? What  communications vehicles are planning team members  already using? Are there lessons learned that the  planning team can benefit from? As appropriate,  coordinate outreach efforts with federal activities,  including National Flood Safety Awareness Week,  Hurricane Preparedness Week, American Wetlands  Month, and others. Be prepared to take advantage of  windows of opportunity, which may come in the form  of extreme weather events (in your state or elsewhere);  the arrival of climate conditions that may affect your  state (e.g., annual storm seasons, El Nio, La Nia);  national media attention, etc. Effective communication has to achieve a match  between message content, framing, and the concerns  and values with which audiences resonate (Bostrom  and Lashof 2007). When communicating with the  public, consider geographic, socioeconomic, and  cultural differences. Who is most vulnerable? What  languages do they speak? What are their interests?  Surveys can help inform the planning team about  how stakeholders feel about climate change and  adaptation and what they value most and may help it  better understand how to engage them on the subject.  For instance, if some stakeholders have doubts about  climate change, or the term itself is too politically  charged, taking an approach that focuses on the impacts  and consequences, many of which they may have  already experienced or are familiar with, may be more  effective.4  A demonstration of the trends can illustrate  the need to take action.

In addition to the education provided via the outreach  program, the planning team may want to work with the  states department of education to create programs to  educate teachers about climate change and to develop  curricula for the classroom. The primary goals of  these efforts should be to equip students with basic  information about climate change and to empower  them to take action and to build awareness among their  family and friends.

By supporting pilot projects,  the state will be able to test out adaptation measures  in a limited number of communities before applying  them statewide. Financial assistance could also be  provided through incentives, where special funds are  only available where prerequisites established by the  state have been met.

Each program should address the  individual needs of the target population, which  could be elected officials; state and local planners,  natural resource managers, or building code officials;  developers; marine contractors; the general public; etc.  For example, a training program to educate elected  officials about their role in climate change adaptation  would look very different from a program designed to  teach marine contractors about living shorelines.  Many local governments already provide map  information services, where they respond to inquiries  regarding the location of a property in relation to  special flood hazard areas as well as its base flood  elevation. However, due to both financial and  technical constraints, this information may be limited  to information on a Digital Flood Insurance Rate  Map. Should the state expand mapping activities to  better capture the location of natural resources and  identify areas susceptible to other coastal hazards,  this information could be passed along (e.g., as GIS  overlays) to local governments to better inform their  map information service as well as their planning  efforts. In addition, this information could be used as  input to a coast-wide web mapping application that  would allow local governments and other stakeholders  to view the location of hazard-prone and natural areas.  In addition to providing data, maps, and models,  which will help lay the foundation for an adaptation  plan, the state can further support the planning  activities of local governments by providing  planning guidance, such as a local version of this  document customized for your state.

While growth  is often desirable and necessary, it must be managed in  a way that addresses the needs of the population and  also offers protection to natural resources and supports  the services they provide.  A robust planning program is essential to effectively  manage growth and development, and it is widely  recognized that land use planning is an effective way  to reduce risks associated with natural hazards (Burby  1998). While most growth will be managed locally,  there is still a role for the state to play, including  restricting growth where it affects state lands and  offering assistance and disincentives (e.g., not providing  funding for infrastructure or other services that will  encourage growth in inappropriate areas) to local  governments.

Growth and development management also includes  loss reduction and shoreline management measures.  These measures are discussed in more detail later in  this chapter.", "449": "Zoning Intended to create a healthy, safe, and orderly  community while balancing a diversity of interests,  ideally as envisioned by a comprehensive plan, zoning is  one of the most commonly used methods of regulating  land use. A number of the measures discussed in this  guide can be implemented through zoning.  Zoning can be used to regulate parcel use, density of  development, building dimensions, setbacks, impervious  surfaces, type of construction (e.g., easily movable),  shore protection structures, landscaping, etc. It can also  be used to regulate where development can and cannot  take place, making it an invaluable tool in efforts to  protect natural resources and environmentally sensitive  areas and guide development away from hazard-prone  areas. Permissible uses and standards vary by zoning  district. Types of districts include general use districts;  overlay districts, where provisions in addition to those  on the underlying districts apply; and special use  districts, in which all uses require permits.  Floodplain zoning is an example of a zoning application  that, if thoughtfully drafted, can provide multiple  benefits. In addition to protecting life and property,  benefits of floodplain zoning can include resource  conservation, open space preservation, public access,  and water-quality protection. Floodplain regulations that  just meet the minimum requirements of the National  Flood Insurance Program are more focused on how to  build safely in the floodplain and may not provide the  additional benefits", "450": "As the climate changes, adjustments will need to be  made. Zoning regulations will need to be adaptive.  Current regulations may need to be revised to  accommodate for new conditions. For example,  regulations that limit building height may need to be  altered in light of changing elevation requirements.  Your state may want to encourage local governments  to review the adequacy of their zoning, make changes  and additions as appropriate, and to consider climate  change in future zoning decisions. As the need for  new districts arises, model language can help ease the  process and advance state interests. Subdivision regulations, which are typically linked to  zoning regulations but often separate, are also useful  tools in limiting development in hazard-prone and  sensitive areas.

A building lost to one  storm is likely to be lost to another if built back  on its prestorm footprint and without significant  structural improvements. Despite the desire to  return to prestorm conditions, it is important  to build back right. Combining restrictions with  acquisition/demolition/relocation programs  provides safer options to property owners in the  wake of the loss of or damage to their homes or  businesses. Such restrictions will likely be more  acceptable if adopted prior to a disaster rather than  during recovery.  Restrictions could apply to repetitive losses or  severe repetitive losses as defined by FEMA, or  they could apply to any structure in a particular  area (e.g., the 100- or 500-year floodplain) that is  destroyed or substantially damaged. A prohibition  on redevelopment of structures destroyed or  substantially damaged by storms or chronic erosion  would serve multiple purposes. It would protect  life and property by removing them from harms  way and allow the natural and beneficial functions  of the floodplain to return. However, an outright  prohibition is often politically and practically  difficult to implement (though less so when public", "452": "health or access is at stake). Restrictions that attach  provisions to reconstruction, such as siting, design, and  construction requirements, are often more achievable. At a minimum, where rebuilding is allowed, general  permitting requirements for new construction  should be enforced, including for those structures  that were nonconforming prior to their loss.  In addition, rebuilding after a loss provides an  opportunity to include additional measures that will  better protect the building and the land on which it  resides", "453": "Conservation Easements A conservation easement is a legal agreement between  a landowner and a land trust or government agency  that can be used to restrict development in sensitive  and hazard-prone areas. Unlike acquisition and open  space preservation and conservation, which are also  useful tools for managing where development takes  place and are discussed in the Loss Reduction and  Coastal and Marine Ecosystem Management categories,  respectively, easements may not preclude other land  uses and allow property to remain in private ownership.  Landowners can sell or donate their easement.  Easements that are sold are also known as PDRs  (purchase of development rights). Landowners who  donate their easement may be eligible for federal  or state tax breaks. Easements typically apply in  perpetuity and are passed on from owner to owner.  Most are placed on individual properties, but they  may also be placed on subdivisions or coordinated  at a regional scale (e.g., to more effectively manage a  strip of shoreline or accommodate beach and wetland  migration).  Conservation easements can be placed on the entire  property or on select areas and can be written to  prohibit all types of development or to impose  restrictions and requirements in regard to size,  construction, etc.5  Easements can also be used to  ban or set standards for shore protection and restrict  ", "454": "activities that may impair natural processes.

", "455": "Compact Community Design Compact community design7  allows development  to occur while protecting natural resources. It is  a pattern of development that aims to use land  more efficiently by grouping a mixed-use of buildings  together, minimizing their collective footprint, and  leaving undeveloped land in its natural state.8  More  open space and fewer impervious surfaces means  reduced runoff and flooding. It also means reduced  investments in services and infrastructure design,  construction, and maintenance. Compact communities  are also known for their walkability, thus compact  community design also helps mitigate climate change. The high density development suggested by compact  community design can allow for more opportunities  to guide development away from sensitive and hazard- prone areas, but without proper planning, it can lead  to increased susceptibility to hazards. Any such design  must still consider the location of hazard-prone  areas as well as the location and carrying capacity of  evacuation routes. Compact community design is best  implemented in conjunction with zoning ordinances  that regulate development in hazard-prone areas and  strong building codes.", "456": "Along heavily developed coastlines, compact  community design may be difficult to implement  since little undeveloped open land will be available.  Nonetheless, there are times when opportunities  may present themselves, including when planning  economic redevelopment projects, when previous  uses on large tracts of land are no longer supported  (e.g., military facilities are closed down), and in the  aftermath of a disaster.", "457": "Acquisition, Demolition, and Relocation The most effective way to reduce losses is to acquire  hazard-prone properties, both land and structures,  demolish or relocate structures, and restrict all future  development on the land. Generally, acquisition is  the best and most cost-effective hazard mitigation  alternative because it permanently removes people  and their homes from harms way (FEMA 1998). In  addition, it can reduce the emotional and financial  costs associated with response and recovery from  future storms, reduce flooding by restoring natural  floodplain functions and increasing flood storage  area, and support environmental and public access/ recreational goals.  While acquisition serves multiple purposes, this  discussion focuses on the acquisition of land  and associated structures that are vulnerable to  natural hazards. The open space preservation and  conservation discussion later in the chapter examines  the acquisition of property primarily for natural  resource protection. Acquisition programs, also known as buyout  programs, typically acquire land and structures and", "458": "require structures to be demolished or relocated  and the land to be deeded as open space in  perpetuity and restored to its natural condition to  allow for more appropriate uses. Factors involved  in the decision to demolish or relocate may include  cost-effectiveness (some structures are easier and  cheaper to move than others), condition of the  structures, property owner interests, availability of  land for relocation, etc. Acquisition/demolition  projects are typically easier to implement than  acquisition/relocation projects. It is a good idea to plan for acquisition by identifying  and prioritizing properties and structures for  acquisition. Target properties may include:  Properties that have suffered multiple losses  (e.g., repetitive loss and severe repetitive loss  properties)  Properties with structures that are  substantially damaged or destroyed  Properties (with and without structures) that  are in an identified hazard-prone area (e.g.,  floodway, sea level rise inundation area, special  flood hazard area, erosion hazard area)  Hazard-prone properties for which retrofitting  (e.g., elevating) is not cost-effective  Properties in potential wetland migration  corridors", "459": "While buyout programs are typically voluntary, where  property owners are not required to sell, other tools  for acquiring structures and property in hazard-prone  areas include exactions and eminent domain. In all  cases, a concerted planning effort, involving potential  sellers where applicable, should be undertaken to help  avoid piecemeal acquisition that might result in coastal  blight or a checkerboard pattern of homes and vacant  lots that would still require public services and may  diminish property values. The actual acquisition may  take place in advance of a hazard event or in the wake  of one, when funding, and willingness to sell, may be  easier to come by and when eminent domain may come  into play. Typically, relocation involves acquiring land and  relocating structures out of harms way rather than  demolishing them. Some relocation projects, for  example, where the majority of the structures are  substantially damaged or destroyed, may involve  demolition along with active efforts to relocate people  into new homes in safer areas. Relocation may occur  at different scales. It may involve moving individual  structures or moving neighborhoods. In some cases, it  may even involve moving entire communities. A plan for relocation that identifies potential structures  for relocation as well as sites that can accommodate  them will ease the process in the context of postdisaster  recoveryor in advance of sea level rise inundation. In  instances where a homeowner of a habitable structure  (i.e., not substantially damaged or destroyed) is interested  in acquisition but not relocation, there may be other uses  for the building that would justify its relocation (e.g., for  local government usage, Habitat for Humanity, domestic  violence shelter, etc.).", "460": "Setbacks While setback and buffer regulations as described  in this guide are similar in effect, they differ in  purpose. The discussion here focuses on the use  of setbacks largely for the purpose of protecting  structures from hazards by keeping the structures  away from a propertys most vulnerable areas. As  such, they are closely tied to other regulations that  manage development in hazard-prone areas, such  as redevelopment, floodplain management, and  shore protection structure regulations. Subdivision  regulations can require lots to be deep enough  to accommodate initial setbacks as well as future  relocations. And, building codes can ensure  structures can be moved with relative ease. Setbacks may be regulated at the state or local level, or  both, and may be based on size or use. Typically, they  require structures to be sited at a distance measured  inland from a specific shoreline feature, such as a high  water mark, vegetation line, dune toe, or bluff crest.  This distance may be a fixed number of feet (e.g., 100  feet) or may be based on the long-term annual rate of  erosion (e.g., 30 times the long-term annual rate of  erosion). Fixed numbers may not be adequate in highly  erosive areas and may be too restrictive in others; and  setbacks based on long-term average annual rates of  erosion do not currently account for how erosion  rates will change as sea level rises. Neither allow for  catastrophic storms.", "461": "A 1990 report from the National Academies  recommended minimum development standards for  areas experiencing significant erosion based on local  rates of erosion (NRC 1990).

Building codes  that regulate design, construction, and landscaping of  new structures can improve the ability of structures  in hazard-prone areas to withstand hazard events  and can also reduce the effects of high temperatures.  They also indirectly protect neighboring structures  and natural resources. Building codes that consider  future conditions and the potential for climate change  and are regularly reviewed and updated based on new  information will provide even greater protection.  According to the Institute for Business and Home  Safety (IBHS 2005): A building code is the minimum acceptable standard used  to regulate the design, construction, and maintenance of  buildings for the purpose of protecting the health, safety,  and general welfare of the buildings users. The purpose of  building codes is to build safe buildings, thereby reducing  deaths, injuries and property damage. This preserves the  built environment, both residential and commercial, reduces  public and private disaster aid, and maintains employment  in businesses and institutions that otherwise might be  forced to close following a catastrophe. The level of protection provided by building codes  depends on the provisions of the codes as adopted  and enforced by state and local governments. State- imposed building codes can help ensure a minimum  level of protection. They may apply statewide, with  more stringent requirements in hazard-prone areas,  or they may apply only in areas susceptible to hazards  such as hurricanes. To provide even more protection  and address specific needs, states can allow local  governments to supplement the states minimum  requirements with additional provisions.  Many states and local building codes are based on  model codes founded on established scientific and  engineering principles. These model building codes  can be modified to better address specific needs and  hazards. The International Code Council maintains the  most up-to-date and widely adopted model building  codes, which incorporate multihazard disaster-resistant", "464": "construction standards. These codes include the  International Residential Code (single- and two- family structures) and the International Building  Code (commercial and multifamily structures). Two  consensus standards from the American Society  of Civil Engineers (ASCE) are referenced in the  International Codes and are also useful resources:  ASCE 24-05 Flood Resistant Design and Construction  and ASCE 7-05 Minimum Design Loads for Buildings  and Other Structures.  Post-disaster assessments have proven that, in most  cases, the use and enforcement of stricter building codes  produce buildings that are more resistant to disasters  (FEMA 2000). However, the enforcement of these codes  is critical to their success. Local building departments are  typically responsible for ensuring builders comply with the  codes so structures provide the base-level of protection  required by the state or local government. Enforcement  activities include permit approval, design and plan review,  and site visits. A successful building code program will  include regular continual training of enforcement agents  as well as education of the building community and  property owners.", "465": "Flood  In Special Flood Hazard Areas (100-year floodplain),  the minimum requirements of the National Flood  Insurance Program (NFIP) include requiring permits  for new and substantially improved development,  elevating the lowest floor of all buildings to or  above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) (alternatively,  nonresidential buildings outside of the V-Zone can be  dry-floodproofed to the BFE); anchoring structures  to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement;  ", "466": "restricting development in the regulatory floodway;  using flood-resistant construction materials and  methods that minimize flood damage; and treating  substantially improved structures like new buildings  that must meet the minimum NFIP standards.

Buildings constructed in  the V-Zone, which is subject to coastal high hazard  flooding where waves during the base flood are at  least three feet, must also be elevated on pilings or  columns (i.e., fill is prohibited), and the bottom of  the lowest horizontal structural member must be  elevated to or above the BFE.

Increased structural wind-resistance can  be achieved by adhering to special design techniques,  using stronger, more wind-resistant materials and  connections, such as hurricane clips and the bracing  of gabled roofs; and protecting openings with impact- resistant materials or shutters", "469": "Retrofitting Although recent improvements in construction  practices and regulations have made new structures  less hazard-prone, many existing structures remain  vulnerable and will likely be more so as climate  changes. And, as these changes are realized and codes  evolve to keep up with them, even structures built to or  above current codes are likely to become threatened. Existing structures can be protected from hazards  through retrofitting.12 While retrofitting may not  bring a structure up to code (unless required during  a substantial improvement), it does help existing  structures better withstand hazard events and may  reduce insurance premiums. Retrofitting techniques  exist for a number of hazards, including floods and  high winds, and many of them are similar to those  required in the construction of new structures.  Examples include:  Elevating or floodproofing flood-prone  structures   Reinforcing and bracing roofs and garage doors  Anchoring homes to their foundations  Installing shutters on windows and other glass  openings  Removing impervious surfaces  Replacing exterior building components with  stronger, more hazard-resistant alternatives Since retrofitting is typically not required, homeowners  may not be aware of what they can do to protect  their homes and themselves. Regular improvement  and maintenance projects provide good opportunities  for homeowners to strengthen their homes as well  as improve the structure and increase its value.

Since infrastructure is  critical to the functioning of a healthy community, it  must be sited, designed, constructed, and maintained  so the provision of services continues uninterrupted.  Infrastructure protection entails fortification against  the impacts of climate change and, in some cases,  shoring up of capacity. While many of the ideas discussed under building  codes and retrofitting also apply to infrastructure, the  value of infrastructure, both socially and economically,  suggests the need for stricter requirements for new  infrastructure construction (e.g., plan for the 500-year  event, rather than the 100-year event) and a more  concerted effort to retrofit existing facilities and  systems. Roads, bridges, water and power utilities,  stormwater systems, and other infrastructure that  are already worn or overcapacity are likely to be  most vulnerable to climate change.13 Addressing and  correcting existing deficiencies needs to be a priority  and should be handled concurrently with adjustments  necessary to meet projected future conditions and  needs. Similarly, adaptation should be considered and  incorporated into regular maintenance and upgrade  activities. In general, designing for the future is less expensive  than retrofitting, rebuilding, or moving infrastructure.  When planning for new infrastructure, siting should  be the first consideration. Facilities and system  components should not be constructed in hazard- prone (current or projected) or valuable natural  resource areas, where possible, or in areas that would  encourage undesirable growth.

However,  they often damage or destroy other valuable coastal  resources (economic, ecological, recreational, and  aesthetic), require substantial expenditure (initial  design and construction and maintenance), and create  a false sense of security. They may also encourage  additional development. Shore protection structures  provide an immediate fix that may not be sustainable.  Nevertheless, it is understood that in some cases,  for the purposes of protecting existing (not future)  development, there may be no other acceptable or  practical options. Alternatives to shore protection  structures are discussed in the Shoreline Management  category that follows.  Shore protection structures are designed to reduce  flooding/inundation and erosion of land and protect  structures and infrastructure. Despite the name, the  intent is to protect the built environment and the land  it sits on rather than the shore itself. 13 Onsite sewage disposal systems will also be vulnerable as sea levels rise and their separation from groundwater becomes inadequate.  Learning from othersMassachusetts Considers  Sea Level Rise in Infrastructure Siting In the 1990s, the Massachusetts Water Resources  Agency designed and built Bostons Deer Island  wastewater treatment plant in consideration of sea  level rise. Specifically, the plant was built 1.9 feet  higher than required at the time to accommodate  the amount of sea level rise projected to occur over  the expected lifetime of the facility (~50 years). And,  in a nod to climate change mitigation, the plant  gets approximately one-quarter of its power needs  through on-site renewable energy sources.  www.mwra.com/03sewer/html/sewditp.htm78 A Planning Guide for State Coastal Managers Most shore protection structures are built parallel or  perpendicular to the shoreline:   Shore parallel (seawalls, revetments, bulkheads,  breakwaters, rip rap)These structures help  hold the land back from the sea and the sea  back from the land and/or dissipate wave  energy.   Shore perpendicular (groins, jetties)These  structures interrupt sediment transport and  trap sediment to build/rebuild beaches and/or  stabilize navigational channels and inlets.  While they may be successful at meeting the level of  protection they are designed for, all of these structures  disrupt the natural flow of sediment, which may result  in the loss of the natural shoreline, coastal habitat, and  the associated ecosystem services and amenities, either  directly in front of the structure or in adjacent areas.  With the exception of breakwaters, which are built  offshore, shore parallel structures also inhibit the ability  of wetlands to migrate inland as sea level rises and may  interfere with public access. In most cases, protection in  one area will lead to losses in another (or the demand for  more shore protection structures), both to the built and  the natural environment. Large flood control systems like dikes (levees) and  movable gates and barriers (e.g., Maeslantkering in  the Netherlands and the Thames River Barrier in the  United Kingdom) are also being considered as viable  defenses against sea level rise. These structures require  significant investment and come with their own set of  concerns and adverse impacts.  When there are no suitable alternatives, future  shore protection structures should be designe", "473": "Regulation and Removal of Shore Protection  Structures As previously discussed, the use of shore protection  structures is only supported as an action of last resort  to protect valuable real estate and infrastructure. They  often do more harm to the natural shoreline than  good. To protect the natural shoreline and the benefits  it provides, states can use regulations to limit shoreline  hardening as well as to promote alternative forms of  protection and to encourage development that reduces  the needs for shore protection structures.  Regulations can specify allowable uses, locations,  and structures, prohibit new structures, and/or  require the removal of existing structures given  specified circumstances (e.g., no longer maintained,  substantially damaged, need to return land to  natural functions, etc.). The size, design, and  placement of shoreline stabilization structures can  also be regulated to minimize environmental and  public access impacts. Regulations that severely  restrict the use of shore protection structures or  require their removal should also require disclosure  of such restrictions in real estate transactions.", "474": "Rolling Easements Rolling easements are shoreline easements designed to  promote the natural migration of shorelines. Typically,  rolling easements prohibit shore protection structures,  which interfere with natural shoreline processes and  movement, but allow other types of development  and activities. As the sea rises, the easement, which  is usually delineated by a physical characteristic such  as the line of vegetation, moves or rolls landward,  sediment transport and wetland migration occur as  nature intended, and public access to the shore is  preserved. Since rolling easements reflect changing  conditions, they are likely to be a more effective  response to the impacts of climate change than  traditional zoning, which is based on conditions at the  time of the rule making. Rolling easements, which may be donated, purchased,  or regulated, place no restrictions on development.  They allow landowners to build anywhere on their  property with the understanding that they will not be  able to hold back the sea by armoring their shoreline  or deny public access. Once the shoreline has eroded  to a point where a privately owned structure is on  public land, a threat to human health and safety,  and/or threatened by flooding and erosion, that  structure should be relocated. The possible need for  relocation may encourage the building of smaller,  more mobile structures that will likely cause less  environmental disruption.", "475": "Living Shorelines In low- to medium-energy coastal and estuarine  environments and tidally influenced creeks,  streams, and rivers, living shorelines can be  effective alternatives to shore protection structures  in efforts to restore, protect, and enhance the  natural shoreline and its environment.

The use of  vegetation and sand fences to build and stabilize  dunes is not a quick fix, will only be effective under  certain conditions, and may not be effective as a way  of encouraging the growth of new dunes where  dunes did not exist in the past.  A number of other measures discussed in this guide  can be used to manage and protect dunes, vegetation,  and associated habitat, including laws and regulations  (e.g., zoning, buffers, setbacks, etc.) that restrict  development and other harmful activities (e.g., sand  mining, foot and vehicular traffic).

Any regional sediment management effort should  include an emphasis on the beneficial use of dredged  material. A sediment management program that  recognizes sediment as a valuable resource and links  needs with appropriate opportunities will be the most  effective at reducing economic and environmental  losses associated with climate change. Beneficial  use of dredged material involves using sediment  dredged from waterways for a productive purpose,  such as beach nourishment, habitat restoration and  development, public access facilities, and shore  protection structures (e.g., levees and dikes), among  other things.", "483": "Ecological Buffer Zones Ecological buffer zones (buffers) are similar to setbacks  (and may be included within setbacks), but are typically  designed to protect the natural, rather than the built,  environment. By protecting natural resources, buffers  protect the natural and beneficial functions those  resources provide. Protective services include providing  habitat and connectivity; minimizing erosion and  flooding by stabilizing soil, providing flood storage, and  reducing flood velocities; and improving water quality  through filtration of harmful sediment, pollutants, and  nutrients. Specifically, buffers are land use regulations designed  to reduce the impacts of land uses (e.g., development)  on natural resources by providing a transition zone  between a resource and human activities. Typically,  buffers are maintained in their natural vegetative  state and activities such as vegetation removal, soil", "484": "disturbance, and construction are restricted or  prohibited. As climate changes, buffers will also be  able to support inland wetland migration as well as  carbon sequestration. The effectiveness of any buffer will depend on  several factors, including size, elevation, vegetation,  slope, soil, permitted activities, adjacent land uses,  stormwater flow, and erosion rate. In addition,  effectiveness will also be dependent on property  owner compliance and the monitoring and  enforcement of buffer regulations.

Specifically, open spaces:  Protect and provide habitat  Reduce flooding and stormwater runoff  Support water quality maintenance  Promote groundwater recharge  Provide opportunities for recreation  Enhance natural and cultural resources  Sequester carbon  Allow for evaporative cooling Open space preservation and conservation can be  accomplished through the management of lands  dedicated as open space through a number of the  measures previously discussed, such as zoning,  redevelopment restrictions, acquisition, easements,  setbacks, and buffers. While there are costs associated  with the management of open space, the public  expenditures may be lower than if the land was  developed and the provision of full services was  required.

However, the  ability to migrate and ultimate sustainability will  depend on factors such as rate of change, topography,  and upland land uses. Although costly and complex,  if migration is constrained, wetland loss may be  compensated for through the creation of new  wetlands in suitable areas.  Steps that can be taken to facilitate wetland migration  include:  Prohibiting and removing shore protection  structures that would impede migration  Acquiring land suitable for migration through  easements or acquisition15  Requiring ecological buffer zones, setbacks,  and/or rolling easements  Adhering to the principles of compact  community design", "490": "Adopting policies that support these activities before  the suitable corridors are overly developed will likely  be more cost-effective and politically palatable than  once development has moved in.

While there is considerable scientific confidence in  support of activities that reduce nonclimate stressors,  the effectiveness of the measures discussed here in  helping systems adapt to climate change is not as  evident, and their consideration, while still essential,  requires a clear understanding of how a system  functions and how it might be affected by climate  change (CCSP 2008b).  These projects should be designed to withstand the  impacts of climate change, incorporating native  species that will be able to adapt to anticipated future  conditions. The focus should be on maintaining and  enhancing connectivity and preserving ecosystem  functionality and services rather than re-creating  a specific species composition. Representation  and replication can help increase the likelihood of  ecosystem or habitat survival.16 Ensuring resilient  native species and habitats are well-represented and  replicated decreases the possibility of catastrophic  events destroying systems.

Any project designed to restore, establish, or  enhance an ecosystem will require planning, long- term management, monitoring, and, possibly,  land acquisition. In general, of the three project types,  restoration is the most likely to be successful (Interagency  Workgroup on Wetland Restoration 2004). The outcomes  of projects that create new ecosystems or new ecosystem  services are more uncertain, especially when the additional  uncertainties of climate change are factored in. Wetland  creation is usually difficult and typically requires a lot more  planning and effort than restoration projects. Generally, it  is easier to create wetlands from open water than it is to  convert uplands. In either case, one type of ecosystem is  likely to be destroyed in order to establish the new one.  Tradeoffs will need to be made and understood.", "496": "Coral Restoring damaged coral reef ecosystems is an  important part of protecting and preserving ecosystem  health. Reef restoration can help prevent further  degradation and facilitate the natural recovery process.  Future work on developing restoration strategies may  ultimately make reefs more resilient to the impacts of  climate change. To date, most restoration efforts have  been focused on repairing damage caused by human  impacts, such as vessel groundings and anchoring,  and these efforts serve to restore natural function,  structure, and diversity among injured reefs. Managers  have conducted pilot projects on applying restoration  techniques that may be used to respond to climatic  event disturbances, such as coral bleaching, and disease  mortality events. Coral reef restoration largely entails stabilizing  and repairing the damaged framework, recreating  topography, and transplanting corals dislodged,  propagated in nurseries, and/or relocated from other  suitable sources (e.g., corals orphaned as a result of  coastal construction projects).

One of the biggest challenges to the implementation of  climate change adaptation actions is funding. This will  likely require creativity and networking and will be an  ongoing effort. Currently, there is not a lot of funding  directly targeted at climate change adaptation. But, there  are a number of grant opportunities for restoration,  conservation, hazard mitigation, infrastructure (e.g.,  installing new/updating existing), and community and  economic development.  Think about how funds from multiple sources can  be combined as well as how you can work with other  jurisdictions (states and local governments), regional  organizations, and nongovernmental organizations to  pool resources to meet complementary needs. Planning  team members should think about the grants they have  applied for in the past and how these funding vehicles  might also support adaptation activities. Funding may  also be available through nonprofit organizations (e.g.,  environmental advocacy groups), private foundations,  and businesses. In addition to funding, these groups  may also be able to provide in-kind goods and services.

How will the planning team keep elected  officials apprised of progress and obstacles?  How will progress be communicated to other  stakeholders outside of the planning team?

This body of knowledge and these knowledge systems can be described as Traditional  or Indigenous knowledges. These knowledges refer to ways of knowing that can encompass culture, experiences,  resources, environment, and animal knowledge that are passed down generationally from elder to youth through oral  histories, stories, ceremonies, and land management practices.10 By providing observational evidence and informing the development of adaptation strategies that are culturally  appropriate, Traditional Knowledges (TKs) are essential to tribal understanding of climate change. Yet, TKs are eroding  as environmental changes and the timing of traditional ecological events become less reliable in determining the timing  and practice of traditional and cultural activities.11 The Guidelines for Considering Traditional Knowledges (TKs)  in Climate Change Initiatives refers to TKs as [I]ndigenous  communities ways of knowing that both guide and result  from their community members close relationships with  and responsibilities towards the landscapes, waterscapes,  plants, and animals that are vital to the flourishing of  [I]ndigenous culture.13 These traditional information  systems are held by tribal members and shared through  tribal community, cultural practices, oral history, as well  as direct family lineage, across multiple generations over  long periods of time. TKs encompass many aspects of  traditional practices and cultural information, not only but  including environmental knowledges. The term Traditional  Ecological Knowledge (TEK) refers to application and  utilization of these generationally based TKs with natural  resources on the landscape in management, collection,  ceremonial sustainability efforts, or reciprocity behaviors  and practices. TEK was first coined as the cumulative  body of knowledge, practice, and belief, evolving by  adaptive processes and handed down through generations  by cultural transmission, about the relationship of living  beings (including humans) with one another and with  their environment.14 This Guidebook recognizes that the  terms Traditional Knowledges and Traditional Ecological  Knowledge are defined and manifested differently among  different tribes and knowledge holders.", "517": "Throughout this Guidebook, the term TKs is used to include both environmentally focused and non-environmentally  focused TKs.

These observations and relevant  TKs that support tribal culture and traditions can be identified and applied to climate change adaptation as appropriate.  Deciding how and where it is appropriate to incorporate TKs is a decision that can only come from each tribal  government and knowledge holder. A knowledge holder is most often a tribal member who has been imparted with and/ or actively participates in TK and/or TEK activities based on generations-worth of information.  When working with partners outside the tribe, sharing TKs requires approval from governing entities such as specific  committees and tribal leadership. Tribes maintain the right not to share TKs with external partners but could incorporate  those knowledges separately as part of their internal planning process. Tribes and knowledge holders have the right to  decline to share TKs and should only share TKs with free, prior, and informed consent.15 It is important to identify tribal policies concerning and addressing Tribal Intellectual Property Rights, which can  include oral traditional information, and understand the tribes legal processes for addressing the information, which is  sometimes prevented from general public release along with the legal restrictions of these tribal intellectual properties.  Using TKs in climate change planning can benefit the tribe, promote greater collaboration with partners, and improve  the outcomes of adaptation planning.

There are also several organizations providing various types of support and resources for tribal climate change  adaptation planning (Appendix A).  This Tribal Climate Adaptation Guidebook builds on the ongoing climate-related work in tribal communities, provides a  framework for climate change adaptation planning in the context of existing tribal priorities, and directly considers the  unique issues facing Indigenous communities. Specifically, this Guidebook directs readers to the foundation of existing  resources and tribal adaptation efforts. It identifies opportunities for braiding together Traditional Knowledges and  Western Science in developing adaptation plans. The framework outlined here will be useful for tribes in different phases  of climate adaptation planning efforts. The framework also supports learning from the experiences, approaches, and  lessons of tribes working to become more resilient to climate change. The Tribal Climate Adaptation Guidebook is designed  to support tribes efforts to proactively adapt to climate change and thrive for generations to come.", "523": "Step 1 offers guidance to Center the Tribes Adaptation Effort in the tribes vision and priorities. Also covered in Step 1 is  guidance on engaging tribal leadership and community members and ways the tribe may consider incorporating TKs in  climate change adaptation planning.  The next four steps constitute the climate adaptation planning process: Identify Concerns and Gather Information  (Step 2), Assess Vulnerability (Step 3), Plan for Action (Step 4), and Implement and Monitor Actions (Step 5). Each step is  connected to and emanates from the tribes vision and priorities and considers multiple knowledges and perspectives  (Figure 2).  ", "524": "The Tribal Climate Adaptation Guidebook can be used by tribes at various stages of adaptation planning, from those that  have worked in this area for years to those that have not yet formulated or initiated a plan. It can help not only those who  are well-resourced, but also in situations where a single tribal staff member may be tasked with outlining an adaptation  plan. The Guidebook need not be followed in sequential order, nor in its entirety. Adaptation planning does not always  happen in order and often follows available funding. The Guidebook is designed so that tribes can work through any  applicable section and skip sections that are not applicable.", "525": "Select Climate Change Planning Approach Many tribes choose to start adaptation planning because of notable changes in the natural environment and a desire to  maintain tribal culture, community health, and ways of life for future generations. Each tribe is unique, having its own  land base, population, history, culture, spirituality, language, government, societal organization, knowledge system,  values, economies, traditions, and relationship with the natural environment. Likewise, the key vulnerabilities around  changing climate conditions, and the adaptation planning process itself, will be unique to each tribe. Climate change planning efforts vary from conducting distinct vulnerability analyses and adaptation plans to integrating  climate change into existing planning efforts, such as:   Emergency response planning;   Drought, heat, and flood planning; and  Natural resource management planning. 1", "526": "Does it make more sense for the tribe to start smallfocusing on a specific sector, species, habitat, community  group, or issueor start more broadly?  Has there been a recent extreme weather event that affected the tribal community, or are extreme events  happening more frequently?  What are the current funding opportunities available? Can they fund some or all of the work that the tribe wants  to accomplish?   Is there an existing planning process or management plan update that could be modified to include climate  change? If the answer is yes, then ask the following questions. If the answers to the following questions are  yes, then this is a great opportunity for mainstreamingan approach to adaptation planning that involves  integrating climate adaptation into existing management functions and planning efforts.3  Does a member of the climate change planning team have a good relationship with the person leading  the existing planning process or management plan update? Does that person have the resources (funding  and/or staff) to help support the inclusion of climate change?  Is there flexibility in the scope of the project to include climate change?  Can the funds for the existing project accommodate additional work to incorporate climate change?  Are there any potential conflicts with incorporating climate change into the project? Can those conflicts  be addressed?", "527": "The climate change planning team will guide the tribes adaptation efforts from start to finish and beyond. The team will  help establish or refine visions, goals, and objectives (Section 1.3). The team will provide critical insights into assessing  vulnerability and risk, selecting adaptation actions, and tracking and evaluating the success of those actions. The team  will be important in reaching out to other members of the community and championing the tribes climate resilience  work.

How long will the current effort within the planning process last?  What time horizons are being planned for? The 2050s, 2080s, or seven generations from now?  Are the actions taken today able to address issues 100 years from now, or should the focus be on actions with a  shorter time frame? Geographic areas: Define the physical area(s) to which the plan applies. This decision is closely linked to the plans goals  and objectives because the plan will need to focus on specific geographic areas in order to achieve the desired outcomes.  What geographic areas will be considered in the current adaptation planning effort? For example, the effort  could be focused on any of the following: the tribal reservation, off-reservation fee land, trust land, traditional  homelands, Usual and Accustomed areas, open and unclaimed areas, treaty areas, a watershed, a segment of  coastline, or land where treaty-protected resources may be affected", "551": "Governance: Identify who has direct management or federal trust responsibilities over the land and natural resources  within the chosen geographic focus area(s) and who could indirectly influence management within the chosen  geographic focus area(s) (for example, federal/state agencies, regional planning organizations).

Many tribes have high  internal staff capacity and technical expertise in the fields of natural resource management and scientific analysis.  However, funding for such positions are often from non-climate change-related grants, which limits their capacity to  devote time to climate change planning and analysis for the tribe.45 Other tribes have limited staff capacity for climate  change analyses.46 As such, many tribes have sought expertise from external partners (e.g., universities, federal agencies  and programs, private and non-profit organizations, and intertribal organizations) for training, data, and analysis to  support the tribes climate change adaptation planning efforts.47 It can be important to identify external partners who may have direct management of federal trust responsibilities  over the land and natural resources within the geographic areas of interest and those who could indirectly influence  management within the geographic areas of interest (e.g., federal agencies, state agencies, and regional planning  organizations).  Developing partnerships with external organizations can have benefits beyond the end of a specific climate adaptation  planning project. Collaborations with academic institutions, non-profit or private sector organizations, and federal  agencies can create avenues for lasting technical, communication, grant writing, implementation, or design support. Some  tribes work with neighboring jurisdictions (e.g., city, county, state, federal, private, and other tribes), particularly in the  cases of checkerboard tribes and tribes that have Usual & Accustomed areas that border or are on private or federal lands.

Western Science uses terms such as Traditional Knowledges and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to describe how longstanding generational tribal knowledges are held, transferred, and applied within a tribe, and  when referring to Indigenous Science. These terms attempt to describe what tribes already do without the tribes labeling  it as such. Identifying where and how TKs and TEK are already being applied can serve as a base to build on within the  tribes climate change adaptation planning process.

Over time and with additional resources, the scope may be expanded to  include all the potential concerns related to climate change and develop adaptation actions for every potential concern. Identifying concerns can be done using a variety of approaches with input from the community and the climate change  planning team.

For some tribes, the planning areas are  based around different topic areas or sectors (e.g. fisheries management, transportation, human health, and emergency  management). Other tribes have created planning areas around habitats (e.g., grouping all related species that are  concerns into that habitat) or by climate impact of concern (e.g., rising sea levels, wildfire risk, and extreme heat). There  may be a few concerns that do not neatly fit within a current department or existing program. Those can be considered  cross-cutting issues, requiring collaboration across departments or programs in order to accurately assess vulnerability  and develop effective adaptation actions. Table 6 lists planning areas defined by different tribes. Note: Upon organizing concerns into planning areas, it may become clear that there are gaps in the expertise of the  climate change planning team. This may be an opportunity to add a member with the appropriate expertise to the team  (Section 1.2) or consult with local or regional experts within the tribe or among external partners (Section 1.8).", "577": "Are there current management programs or plans that are already designed to work on or manage the identified  concerns?

Within the climate change planning team, discuss how many concerns can successfully be addressed over the course of  the current effort. Keeping the tribes goals for adaptation planning in mind, look for opportunities to mainstream to help  identify which concerns to focus on first.

There may also be thresholds that, if crossed, will have a  disproportionate impact. For example, warmer water temperatures can negatively affect salmon survival. Water  temperatures exceeding 15.5C [59.9F] increase the rate of disease and mortality among Chinook salmon.6 For each key concern, list climate variables that the concern is sensitive to, making note of particular thresholds.

To evaluate the credibility of individual climate change studies, consider the  following questions from Preparing for Climate Change: 11  Are the authors clearly identified as experts?  Has the study been peer-reviewed?  Does the studys results make sense?  Are the results placed in the context of existing understanding?  Is there supporting evidence for the studys conclusions?

Changes in the extent, magnitude, and frequency of  extreme weather events can have significant effects on the things the tribe cares about. Using existing resources  available for climate projections, it is possible to identify quantitative projections for many of these climate exposures.  Where quantitative projections are not available, exposure can be qualitatively assessed (i.e., identifying direction and  magnitude). See Section 2.4 for more guidance on collecting and summarizing relevant and actionable climate exposure  information. Sensitivitydepends on the nature of the key concern and the climate exposure variable. A particular concern may  be very sensitive to changes in water availability but only slightly sensitive to changes in temperature. For example, the  different tree species pinyon pine and douglas fir, which live near each other in dry coniferous forests, will likely be  exposed to the same increases in temperature and potential drought conditions. However, each species has a different  level of tolerance of drought conditions and thus can be more or less sensitive to those conditions.17 Similarly, due to  physiology, elders and youth are more sensitive to extreme heat events than young adults and adults.18  Adaptive Capacityof a key concern is critical in determining the impacts to climate and extreme weather events.  Identifying key limitations to adaptive capacity can help determine how to design and focus adaptation actions to  reduce those limitations and help the species, asset, or system respond positively to projected changes. For example, with  changing food supplies in a particular habitat, a generalist species that eats a variety of plants will likely have a higher  adaptive capacity than specialist species that relies on only one or two plants for survival. Similarly, a drinking water  supply system that has two water sources (groundwater and surface water) and two sets of pumps is better prepared to  shift between those sources if one source is affected by changing precipitation patterns (has higher adaptive capacity)  than a water supply system dependent on a single water source.  ", "594": "Determine Relative Vulnerability Rankings The tribe can use relative vulnerability rankings to help determine where to focus adaptation planning efforts.  Assigning sensitivity and adaptive capacity scores for the range of climate exposures can be used to calculate the relative  vulnerability of each of the key concerns. One way to do this is by using a relative vulnerability matrix.  High vulnerability key concerns (e.g., orange and red colors in Figure 10) that have higher sensitivities and lower  adaptive capacities. This means that those areas are likely to be affected first and worst by the changing climate  conditions.   Lower vulnerability key concerns (e.g., light and dark green colors in Figure 10) have lower sensitivity and higher  adaptive capacities. This means that those key concerns are not as likely to be affected, wont be affected  immediately, or may be areas of opportunity for the tribe in the future. For example, some species and resources  may actually do better with changing climate conditions, creating potential economic or other opportunities for  the tribe. There are a variety of approaches tribes have used to complete a relative vulnerability assessment process (See Section 3.1 and Section 3.2). A relative vulnerability matrix (Figure 10) such as the one used by the Jamestown SKlallam Tribe, can  summarize information that the tribe can use to focus planning efforts.

Is the species of concern currently located near the edge or lowest  elevation portion of its range? Is the infrastructure item or asset designed to operate in the projected range of  climate changes? Adaptive Capacity20  Is the key concern already able to accommodate or respond to current extremes? What about projected changes in  climate?  How easy or hard will it be for the system to adjust to the future changes? Why?   Are there alternative options (e.g., redundancy) for the key concern if one aspect of it is damaged?  Are there barriers to the systems ability to accommodate changes in climate (e.g., regulations based on historic  climate conditions; other competing uses of the system; high number of organizations involved in managing the  system; or biologic, geographic, or physical barriers)?  Will the rate of climate change be faster than the systems ability to adapt?  Are there other stresses on the planning area that will reduce its ability to adapt to climate change?  Does the tribe currently have the capacity to address the impact with minimal cost and disruption?", "596": "Complete a Qualitative or Quantitative Risk Assessment A risk assessment is the process of identifying the probability of occurrence multiplied by the magnitude of  consequences of an adverse event or impact. Using a risk assessment, or other approach, to assess the consequences of  changes in climate can help determine which issues will have the greatest impact on the community. Some tribes use  explicit consideration of risk to help determine where to focus their adaptation planning efforts. Others incorporate  consideration of risk into a multi-criteria assessment process. Either way, the goal is to use the information to determine  where to focus the tribes adaptation planning efforts.", "597": "Identify Priority Planning Areas The results of the risk assessment will guide the selection of priority planning areas. In some cases, these planning areas  may be pre-determined by the adaptation planning approach or may be further refinements of the initial planning areas  identified in Section 1.1. In other cases, they may be a subset of those initial areas focusing on the highest vulnerability,  highest risk, or near-term opportunities for action (depending on the criteria used in the assessment). This selection of  planning areas to focus on (or the refinement of key concerns to focus on within a planning area) can help target funding,  resources, and time on the areas where investment is most needed.", "598": "Collaborate with the appropriate members of the planning team, community, partners, and others in the assessment  process to determine the criteria for selecting planning areas to move forward into the planning for action phase.

Would people be endangered, or merely  inconvenienced?

Adaptation goals are general statements about what the tribe wants to accomplish in  a priority planning area. 1  The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group guidebook, Preparing for Climate  Change: A Guidebook for Local, Regional, and State Governments, recommends being specific about the timeframe for goals,  remembering the audience for goals, engaging others outside the planning team, and following guiding principles for  goal development.2  When setting adaptation goals, consult the tribes vision and overall goals for adaptation planning  (Section 1.3).

Departments, agencies,  and other entities within the tribe may already be thinking about climate change. Identify any adaptation efforts in  existing tribal plans for natural resources, environmental, cultural, transportation, or other public service sectors. Work  already underway, or planned for, likely has the departmental and institutional support and funding to be carried out.

For  example, an action from the US Forest Service Adaptation Resource that says: maintain or restore riparian areas by  promoting a diversity of tree and plant species to increase stream shading, provide a source of woody debris, stabilize the  soil, and provide habitat and connectivity for wildlife6  would ideally be modified to specify which types of trees to plant  and where to plant them.  Gather as many adaptation actions as possible from a variety of sources and then refine those actions, making them  relevant to the tribe. When gathering adaptation actions, consider actions within the categories defined in Table 9. Also,  the tribes staff, climate change planning team, and community members may come up with new possibilities. The  inclusion of TKs within this process has the potential to inform the development of adaptation actions that are better  connected to and support the tribes traditional practices and culture. Create a structure to organize the collected adaptation actions. It may be convenient to organize actions by planning area  and associated goals.

There are multiple ways to do this. One way is to work through each action and assign a score  (e.g., 1 to 3, or 1 to 5) for each of the criterion for each adaptation action. Actions that score higher could be prioritized for  implementation. Note: Some categories, such as cost, may need to be scored in reverse (low cost = 3, high costs = 1) so that  the sum adequately helps prioritize lower costs actions if that is a goal for the tribe.  After evaluating adaptation actions using the selection  criteria, the planning team will decide how to rank the  actions. There are many ways to do this ranking. The  tribe could, for example, choose the top three adaptation  actions based on score, choose to pursue all actions that  exceed a minimum scoring threshold, or group actions  based on what can be done now or in the future (see call  out box). See Case Studies for additional examples. No matter what  approach is taken to evaluate and prioritize adaptation  actions, this is a great place in the process to set the  foundation for monitoring and evaluating (Step 5) the  success of those actions. If ideas about how actions should  be monitored or tracked arise in this process, document  those ideas so they can be considered and/or used in  Step 5.", "614": "Guiding Questions  Which selection criteria (Table 10) are most relevant to the tribe?   What other selection criteria does the tribe want to include to best reflect tribal priorities?   Given the tribes current funding and approach, what is the best way to evaluate the actions (e.g., in a working  meeting, through a workshop, or through electronic or paper surveys)?  How are a diverse set of perspectives and expertise being incorporated into the evaluation process?  How will the actions be adaptively managed and allow for learning?", "615": "Create Implementation Plans for Prioritized Actions An implementation plan creates a road map for each action that can be followed one piece, one sector, or one department  at a time. Ask tribal staff members, community members, and other partners (if applicable) to review the adaptation  action text for their individual areas of expertise and ask them to add relevant context, set appropriate targets, and  highlight areas of overlap with other existing resources and projects. The implementation plan also creates a framework  to track the effectiveness of the selected actions and report to the tribe and other stakeholders. When creating an  implementation plan, consider, at a minimum, the following items:   Timeframe for action;  Lead (person, group, department, or agency);  Partnerships required (if necessary);  Funding required;  Indicators of success; and  Opportunities for mainstreaming with existing department responsibilities and actions.  Look for diverse and comprehensive funding sources that can support a wide range of actions, including infrastructure  and restoration (see Section 1.7). To the extent possible, identify when adaptation actions can be integrated into existing  departmental operations and management. Mainstreaming adaptation into ongoing efforts can be critical for securing  support and funding for implementing these actions. In addition, using an existing structure for tracking the success of  the actions makes monitoring and evaluation easier. The Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals highlights this in  their Adaptation Toolkit by saying that it is important to work with each department of the tribal government to integrate  the adaptation plan into ongoing planning and management activities of all tribal departments. It might be included in  other plans such as a natural resource plan, drought management plan, or disaster preparedness plan, etcThe ultimate  goal of developing and implementing a climate change adaptation plan is to make your tribe more resilient to climate  change.20", "616": "For the prioritized adaptation actions, what will make that action successful in the community?  Who (individuals or departments) will lead the implementation of each action?  How much will it cost and what are potential funding sources?  What partnerships (if any) are required to make the implementation successful?  What is the timing for implementation?  What opportunities exist for mainstreaming this action into existing processes, plans, or management  responsibilities?  How far in the future will the implementation be checked on?  What is the authority and capacity needed to implement each action? Is that capacity sufficient? If not, what needs  to be improved to make the implementation successful.  ", "617": "4.5 Sharing the Story of the Tribes Adaptation Work", "618": "Compile Written Documents This is a great point in the adaptation planning to collect and synthesize the products developed over the course of  the adaptation planning process. This compilation may include semi-final products (such as the prioritized adaptation  actions developed in Section 4.3, or process documents (such as folders of meeting notes, survey results, and slides from  presentations). Once the resources are compiled, the planning team may identify key gaps or decide it is valuable to add  additional documents describing the process or the end products.", "619": "Create Outreach Products Look for creative ways to develop outputs of the adaptation planning process that serve a variety of needs and make the  results more meaningful to key audiences, such as tribal leadership, funders, tribal members, and other partners.  Take a step back from the details of the climate change adaptation process and work with the planning team to identify  ways to share the tribes building resilience story. This may simply mean distilling technical reports into graphically  focused summary sheets that can be read by tribal members who do not have a technical background. It may mean  creating content for a weekly radio segment or posts in a tribal newsletter to share results or continue the resilience  dialogue in the community. Or, it may mean investing in the development of a video (or series of videos) that shares the  results of the tribes work and can reach an audience that would not be reached through reports or documents. Note: The process used for incorporation of Traditional Knowledges (TKs) can further support the appropriate use of that  information in other efforts that benefit the tribe, such as grants or management practices.", "620": "Develop a Communications Plan For each of the outreach materials or approaches selected, develop a communications plan. To be effective, this plan  should include identifying: the audience(s) for this information; how best to reach those audiences; the key messages of  the materials; and any desired calls to action. Consult Section 1.6 to find effective ways to engage and communicate with  different audiences within the tribal community. These outreach products can also be a great way to celebrate progress on adaptation. While adaptation planning is  never truly done, taking time to share the results broadly with, and beyond, the community is a great way to reward the  planning team for their hard work and acknowledge all the hard work that has gone into building resilience. ", "621": "What information can and cannot be shared, written, or documented?  What opportunities exist to create products that share the results in innovative ways and help build support  for adaptation throughout the tribe? (Approaches may include, but are not limited to, graphics, videos, radio  broadcasts, and newsletters.)  What opportunities exist to incorporate results of the adaptation planning process into existing management  plans, policies, procedures, and approaches?   Can results of the adaptation planning process be posted on the tribes website and shared through tribal  networks to support and inform the work of other tribes? If not all of the information can be shared, are there  portions of it that can be shared?", "622": "Identify Initial Adaptation Actions There are many ways to move forward implementing actions. One challenge is that rarely is it possible to move forward  with all of the priority actions (Section 4.4) at the same time. Consider starting with low or no-cost actions like outreach  and education; or focusing on a key window of opportunity (e.g., a grant-funded activity, an update to a management  plan) as this can be a good opportunity to begin implementing priority actions.  The climate change planning team has already helped identify actions relevant to their tribal departments. The key is to  start with a few small elements and move forward from planning to action. This will demonstrate tangible progress to  the community, tribal leadership, and potential funders, that can help create the momentum for tackling the harder, or  bigger, actions and changes identified in the plan. The plan itself can be used to support grant applications and justify  funding for implementing individual adaptation actions.  ", "623": "Consider Implementing a Pilot Project The planning team can consider implementing a pilot project (or a set of pilot projects) to test the effectiveness of priority  actions, and to decide how best to launch each adaptation action at scale. Pilot projects have the benefit of not being seen  as permanent and frequently face lower political and financial barriers. If successful, a pilot project (limited in extent or  geographic scope) can rapidly be scaled or rolled out to other areas. Pilot projects demonstrate measurable success and  can:  Help identify obstacles, logistical challenges, and possible unintended consequences in a semi-controlled, small- scale context;  Help determine if goals and timelines are appropriate and that the appropriate tracking, monitoring, and  reporting takes place;  Provide a forum for gathering feedback from tribal members, staff, and leadership that can be used to inform the  full-scale roll out of the action; and  Secure tribal and staff buy-in. A pilot project isnt always necessary. A full-scale launch may be appropriate where similar adaptation actions have  been previously executed under similar conditions (for example, by other tribes, or in areas with similar geography and  topography) with successful results. Full-scale implementation is also appropriate for smaller actions, or if an immediate  response to an urgent vulnerability is necessary.", "624": "What are the key near-term opportunities to integrate actions into ongoing activities or into management plan  development/update?  Where can the tribe have immediate success and demonstrate action?  Where can implementation tasks be mainstreamed so that they fit within tribal staff members existing  responsibilities?", "625": "5.2 Monitor & Evaluate Actions", "626": "Develop Indicators of Success for Each Action To increase effectiveness of adaptation actions, consider developing one or more indicators that can be monitored to  determine if the actions are successful in having the desired effect. These indicators can be focused on specific individual  components of the process (e.g., number of people trained and workshops held) or specific outcomes (e.g., increased  awareness). Process indicators can be used to track progress in implementing action. Outcome indicators can be used  to track progress in reducing environmental risk and enhancing resilience. When developing both types of indicators,  consider the principles for developing good indicators of adaptation success (Table 11). Table 11 Principles for Developing Indicators of Adaptation Success. This table describes three principles and their rationales to  consider when developing indicators of success for adaptation actions. Principle Rationale Focusing on the Purpose Keeping in mind the communitys vision and guiding principles is important for  developing useful and relevant metrics of success. The metrics should:   Align with the tribal communitys vision and goals;  Keep the intended user of the information in mind;   Be assigned to a specific person or department;  Be relevant to any applicable decision-making processes within the tribe; and   Be shared broadly to keep the community engaged. Systems Thinking Everything is connected. Adaptation indicators need to take into account the larger systems  that affect adaptation outcomes. The measures should match the scale of the adaptation  action to the level of integration with other sectors. Creating a group of holistic and  balanced indicators can paint a more realistic picture. For example, consider:  Short- and long-term measures;   Small- and large-scale measures;   Objective and subjective measures; and  Indicators that track primary, secondary, and cascading impacts. Delivering Impact A good indicator will enable verification of the stated adaptation goals. Ensure validity,  where possible make them quantitative, and base them on performance and consequences. Source: Urban Sustainability Directors Network, Developing Urban Climate Adaptation Indicators (Urban Sustainability Directors  Network, 2017). There are multiple criteria for selecting indicators. See Case Studies and Resources for examples. Using measurable  indicators that can be objectively evaluated over time will help assess progress in implementing the adaptation actions.  Indicators can help simplify reporting on progress to tribal members, leadership, and other stakeholders. Consistent  reporting helps to generate additional interest, promote accountability, improve project management, and attract political  and financial support for the resilience building initiative. The tracking timeline will vary depending on the type of  adaptation actions selected. However, this stage is valuable whenever it occurs because it offers the opportunity for  reflection, revision, and improvemen", "627": "Commit to Monitoring Indicators Once the tribe has selected a set of indicators, develop an approach for tracking these indicators and progress in  implementing the adaptation actions overtime. Early planning helps ensure that systems are in place to collect  information throughout the implementation of the adaptation plan. Determining how well the actions are working is vital  for ensuring that the tribe meets the goals and objectives for the adaptation planning process.  Developing an efficient, consistent, and reliable approach for collecting and managing the indicators can include:  Identifying which members of the planning team will help with each of the tracking and reporting tasks;  Creating a schedule for collecting the information;  Deciding on the methods used to collect and document this information (if possible integrate information  collection into an existing process or standard operating procedure); and  Establishing how the information will be reported. Finally, the climate change planning committee does not have to disband upon the completion of the adaptation plan.  This group can be instrumental in implementing actions, monitoring the success of those actions, and continuing to  guide the tribes adaptation efforts.", "628": "What have other tribes and governmental or nonprofit entities done? Reviewing published adaptation plans to  explore existing tracking methods, networks, and long-term datasets can help identify appropriate indicators.   What are the best and most appropriate ways to monitor the success of implementing each action?   Who will be responsible for tracking this information?  How will that information be shared back to departmental or tribal leadership and the community?  Can the indicators being tracked be compiled and used to inform future efforts?  Does each indicator have a measurable value or benefit to the target audiences?  Does the suite of selected indicators cover each component of the plan?  Who is the target audience? Beyond tribal members, are there other decision-makers or technical experts that the  tribe wants to keep apprised of progress?  How can the information be delivered to best reach the target audience? For example, a simple set of graphics  alone might do the trick for a large group of stakeholders, but a detailed report might be more effective for a  group of technical experts.  How frequently will these indicators be updated and reported?", "629": "Compile Materials Created Throughout the Process Compiling a cohesive set of materials from the adaptation planning process and filling in any gaps by creating summary  reports will solidify the foundation for future work. If the work has been funded by an outside agency or grant, there are  generally requirements to submit the final products as part of the end of the grant period. Gather materials from each  step of the process, and organize those materials in a manner that will be useful for the tribe. Gathering materials is  easiest when documenting progress along the way.  ", "630": "Finalize Outputs of the Adaptation Planning Process Writing a stand-alone adaptation plan may be required by the funders, but is not the only way to document the results  of the adaptation planning process and make those results accessible and useful. Look for ways to develop outputs  that serve a variety of needs. These synergies can be found in mainstreaming actions and developing approaches to  monitoring and evaluation that help measure the success of the plan over time. The process used for incorporation  of Traditional Knowledges (TKs) can further support the appropriate use of that information in other efforts such as  applying for future grants, improving management of natural resources and identifying cultural resources.", "631": "Present Final Materials to Tribal Leadership The compiled set of resources and any plan or summary should be reviewed by the climate change planning team. It also  may be valuable (or required) to present the plan to tribal leadership for formal adoption.

", "633": "5.4 Continue Building Resilience", "634": "Successful adaptation planning requires an understanding that social and environmental conditions will continue to  change for decades and generations. Because of this, adaptation actions will also need to be updated over time. The  climate change planning team or departmental managers (if the actions are mainstreamed) can plan to revisit and modify  the adaptation plan from time to time as new information about expected climate changes and impacts become available  and as the tribes priorities change.8 If possible, set a goal to return either to this full adaptation planning process (Figure 11) (starting at Step 2) in a certain  number of years, or to revisit the plans and programs in which the adaptation actions are embedded as those plans  are updated. Setting a public goal or requirement to update the plan can enhance accountability and help ensure the  investment of time and energy needed to make the updates.  As the plans are updated, explore opportunities to increase the effectiveness of adaptation actions; discontinue ineffective  actions; and incorporate new information, data, resources and/or changes to non-climate factors as appropriate. Consider  reconvening the planning team, community members, or tribal leadership who had been involved in the planning  process and incorporate feedback into any updates or adjustments.", "635": "When updating or revising the plan consider the following:  The Monitoring Plan: Have actions been successful? Where have they fallen short and what could be done to  improve the effectiveness of those actions?   The Tribal Community: Are there new challenges facing the community that need to be addressed requiring  new focus areas or priorities? Has the social or political climate altered and affected tribal priorities?  The State of the Science: Do new climate projections match those in the tribes plan or have scientists discovered  something new that needs to be incorporated into the planning efforts? (For example: the Jamestown SKlallam  Tribe completed their climate adaptation plan9  in 2013 using three sea level rise scenarios. In 2015, the Tribe  participated in the development of a regional climate preparedness plan for the North Olympic Peninsula,10 which took advantage of new sea level projections that assigned likelihoods to various future sea level scenarios.  While the differences between the 2013 and 2015 sea level projections were subtle, the 2015 projections allowed  for better prioritization and ranking of vulnerabilities in the areas of interest.11)  The Vulnerability Assessment: Is there any new information that would inform or change the vulnerability  assessment results? Do the criteria for prioritizing key concerns need to be altered based on changes in tribal  priorities?  New Windows of Opportunity: Are there new opportunities for funding or actions that the tribe can take  advantage of to expand the reach and effectiveness of the adaptation actions in the plan?  Enhancing resilience to changing climate conditions is a process and not the result of a single project. The work that the  tribe does in this adaptation planning process outlined in this Tribal Climate Adaptation Guidebook lays the foundation  for all future adaptation planning efforts. This work includes: identifying key climate-related vulnerabilities; convening  the right people to develop effective adaptation actions to reduce those vulnerabilities in a culturally grounded and  appropriate manner; meaningfully engaging the community; incorporating Traditional Knowledges where appropriate;  developing and institutionalizing indicators to measure success; and committing to revisit and update data, products,  materials, and plans over time. A solid adaptation planning foundation can support the tribe long after the funding for  any single adaptation effort runs out.

These changes are statewide  averages. Heat waves are projected  to become longer, more intense, and  more frequent.  Warming temperatures are expected  to increase soil moisture loss and lead  to drier seasonal conditions. Summer dryness may become prolonged, with soil  drying beginning earlier in the spring and lasting longer into the fall and winter  rainy season.  High heat increases the risk of death from cardiovascular, respiratory,  cerebrovascular, and other diseases.23  Droughts are likely to become more frequent and persistent through 2100.   Climate change is projected to increase the strength of the most intense  precipitation and storm events affecting California.  Mountain ranges in California are already seeing a reduction in the percentage  of precipitation falling as snow. Snowpack levels are projected to decline  significantly by 2100 due to reduced snowfall and faster snowmelt.   Marine layer clouds are projected to decrease, though more research is needed  to better understand their sensitivity to climate change.

Equity means that all people are justly and fairly included in society and that everyone  is able to participate, prosper, and achieve their full potential.24 It recognizes that  everyone enjoys different advantages and faces different challenges, and that  everyone should be treated justly and fairly according to their circumstances.  Equity should be treated as a critical component of all planning, including climate  adaptation planning. Equitable climate adaptation planning involves identifying  persons who may be most vulnerable to climate change and ensuring that planning  processes, distribution of resources, and efforts to address systemic wrongs are all  conducted in an equitable manner.", "670": "First, adaptation planning should look at climate vulnerability through the lens of the  adopted definition by the Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Programs  (ICARPs) Technical Advisory Council. ICARPs Technical Advisory Council developed  Defining Vulnerable Communities in the Context of Climate Adaptation to provide a  clear understanding of the many elements that characterize vulnerable populations  in the adaptation context. This guide provides the climate vulnerability assessment  tools to evaluate climate risk and adaptive capacity, specific indicators to include in  vulnerability assessment, and the following definition of vulnerable communities: Climate vulnerability describes the degree to which natural, built, and  human systems are at risk of exposure to climate change impacts. Vulnerable  communities experience heightened risk and increased sensitivity to climate  change and have less capacity and fewer resources to cope with, adapt to,  or recover from climate impacts. These disproportionate effects are caused by  physical (built and environmental), social, political, and/or economic factor(s),  which are exacerbated by climate impacts. These factors include, but are not  limited to, race, class, sexual orientation and identification, national origin, and  income inequality.25", "671": "Defining Vulnerable Communities in the Context of Climate Adaptation", "672": "The Fourth Climate Change Assessment and related research also affirm that several  communities already feel the cumulative burden of climate change, environmental  pollution, and historical socioeconomic disparities.26 It is important to identify and  acknowledge these communities because there is an opportunity in climate  adaptation planning to address issues holistically. Communities that have long  experiences with systemic exclusion and resource deprivation have developed assets,  coping skills, and knowledge that can benefit overall climate resilience planning.  Robust community engagement in plan development, as recommended throughout  the APG, can bring these communities wisdom into local resilience efforts. ", "673": "Second, through all phases of adaptation planning, it is helpful to think of equity as  multidimensional and having three objectives: 1) procedural, 2) distributional, and  3) structural (see Table 3).27 State agencies and tribal governments have additional  resources for equity and inclusion in adaptation planning, including the California  Department of Public Healths Climate Change and Health Equity Program, the  California Environmental Protection Agencys Office of Environmental Justice, the  California Office of Emergency Services Access and Functional Needs Section, and  the Pala Band of Mission Indian Tribe Environmental Departments climate adaptation  resources and templates. Table 3. TYPES OF EQUITY IN ADAPTATION PLANNING Procedural  Equity  Create processes that are transparent, fair, and inclusive in  developing and implementing any program, plan, or policy.  Ensure that all people are treated openly and fairly.  Increase the civic engagement opportunities of communities that  are disproportionately impacted by climate change. Distributional  Equity  Fairly distribute resources, benefits, and burdens.  Prioritize resources for communities that experience the greatest  inequities and most disproportionate impacts and have the  greatest unmet needs. Structural  Equity  Make a commitment to correct past harms and prevent future  unintended consequences.  Address the underlying structural and institutional systems that are  the root causes of social and racial inequities.  Include adaptation strategies to eliminate poverty, create  workforce development, address racism, increase civic  participation, protect housing availability, increase education,  and provide healthcare.

This includes building support from community elected officials, civic leaders, and  community-based organizations.", "675": "Local agency stakeholders. Since climate adaptation affects all aspects of a  community, adaptation strategies should be developed by an adaptation team  assembled from local agency staff who can provide data, insight, and ideas.  The most common government agencies and departments include planning June 2020 31 California Adaptation Planning Guide (land use and environmental), community development, building, engineering,  public works, emergency management, police, fire, finance, public health, and  environment.

National, state, and regional  government agencies, including tribal governments and communities; academic  and research institutions; and nonprofit organizations, preferably those located in  or near the community, can provide data, guidance, and sometimes funding in  support of climate adaptation planning.

Scoping the planning process includes determining how to publish, adopt, and  implement the results. Adaptation work typically becomes part of one of three main  categories of planning mechanisms: 1) comprehensive plans, 2) focused plans, and 3)  implementation programs (see Figure 6).  The comprehensive plans establish a framework and overarching guidelines for  adaptation planning and implementation.  The focused plans set more-specific objectives based on the framework and  guidelines.  The implementation programs lay out and enact actions to achieve the specific  objectives and are generally implemented on an ongoing basis.", "681": "The adaptation planning process  presented in Phases 1 through 4 of  the APG can result in one or more of  the above plans or outcomes. The  APG focuses on three outcomes of a  local adaptation planning process: 1)  safety element and/or other elements  of a general plan, 2) stand-alone  climate action or adaptation plan,  and 3) local hazard mitigation plan.  Communities are not limited to integrating  adaptation planning work into these  three mechanisms, and the California  Government Code  65302(g)(4) allows  for any plan or document containing  this information to meet the states requirements. However, in practice, the general  plan, climate action or adaptation plan, or local hazard mitigation plan are the most  commonly used options to ensure that climate adaptation is addressed in a holistic  and fully integrated way. The Introduction of this guide provides more information  about these local planning efforts.", "682": "Equity. A resilient community is one in which all members of a community are  able to effectively prepare for and recover from acute and chronic climate  impacts. Ideally, all community members are equally resilient regardless of  income, health, identity, education, and other socioeconomic factors. Removing  all disparities is an aspirational goal and may be beyond what an individual  community can achieve, but a resilient community should strive for confidence  that all members of the community are prepared for and able to recover from  climate change impacts.", "683": "Holistic approach. Ensuring the health and safety of community members  is critical to building resiliency, but it is not the only factor. Total community  well-being depends on many different systemsbuilt, natural, and sociopolitical.  For example, if a wildfire damages a forest, the number of tourists may drop,  which may result in economic hardship for communities with tourist-based  economies and affect the well-being and adaptive capacity of people who own  and work at such businesses. A resilient population is not possible if the systems  that people depend on are not themselves resilient. Additionally, a regional  approach to climate adaptation can help ensure an efficient and effective  process that gets the greatest possible benefit from limited resources.", "684": " Future needs. Communities are constantly changing. As buildings are  constructed and torn down, people move in and out, businesses open and  close, and other systems in a community change, the resiliency needs of the  community change as well. For example, many older Americans want to stay  in their homes or communities rather than moving to retirement homes or June 2020 39 California Adaptation Planning Guide assisted care facilities, which creates a different set of resiliency needs. When  thinking about what resiliency means for the community, consider it from the  perspective of community members of all ages and future assets, not only  current ones. Additionally, some communities adopt ambitious housing plans  to help bridge severe gaps between community needs for affordable housing  options and current supply. These housing plans substantially influence the  resilience of precariously housed low-income households and individuals currently  experiencing homelessness due to lack of housing supply", "685": "COMMUNITY VISION FOR ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE A vision statement captures what  community members most value about  their community and what they want their  community to become. When drafting  a vision statement, it is helpful to think  about how the community will be similar  or different in the future (e.g., in 10, 20, 30,  or 50 years or more)how it will function,  what it will be known for, who will be  served by the community and its services,  what it will look like, what resources will be  needed, and more. Preparation of a vision statement should  be as inclusive as possible. Visioning is  often the first activity of a community  engagement process. The process can  include a variety of activities to engage  stakeholders in visioning. Ultimately, the  ideas and recommendations should be  compiled into a single draft vision that is  vetted through the adaptation planning  process. Goals should be statements of the desired  outcomes from the adaptation planning  process based on the vision of a resilient  community. A vision statement and goals  should reflect the needs, priorities, and  values of the community and of the  stakeholders involved in the planning  effort. Consider visions and goals that  help connect local adaptation planning  to State efforts, such as the ICARP vision and principles. Establishing goals early creates  a common foundation for the future work of everyone involved. Participants can refer  back to these goals throughout the planning process to help ensure that they are on the  right track. Later in the process, after preparing the vulnerability assessment, participants  prepare more-specific goals as a framework for the adaptation policies. Phase 3 of the  APG provides additional guidance for drafting goals.", "686": "HAT IS THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA? The participating jurisdictions usually  define the geographic area of the plan  or project. For example, a city conducting  adaptation planning efforts will focus on  building resiliency within its city limits or  sphere of influence. Similarly, a countys  efforts usually support adaptation  in unincorporated areas within its  boundaries. Regional governments may  also conduct adaptation work for all  jurisdictions in their area, and multiple  jurisdictions may collaborate on regional  adaptation work, creating a geographic  area that spans multiple jurisdictions.  However, sometimes the planning  area is not as clear cut as political  boundaries. Adaptation planning for  a natural resource or ecosystema  watershed, for examplemay need  to cover a broad area that does not  follow political boundaries. Even if the  planning effort is limited to a specific  area with defined boundaries (such  as a state park), natural areas outside  of these boundaries may need to be  included to the extent possible to help  ensure resiliency. Specific areas within a  community, such as neighborhoods or  defined frontline communities, may also be the focus of an adaptation planning effort.  Frontline communities are populations that experience the impacts of issues such  as environmental pollution, climate change, and the economic crisis first and most  severely. They are most often communities of color and/or low-income.4", "687": "WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME FOR THE PLANNING PROCESS? Like all other planning efforts, adaptation planning requires time and effort. Local  government agency staff and other stakeholders will need to commit their time,  technical and financial resources, and the available knowledge of everyone involved  to ensure a successful process.  The time frame for the adaptation planning process may be determined by a grant,  budget cycle, direction from elected officials, community priorities, or other factors.  The breakdown of the adaptation planning process in Table 4 shows the phases and  steps in this guide and estimates the timing of each step. Steps may take more or  less time depending on capacity, funding, scope details, and other characteristics.  Following all phases could take 12 to 24 months, depending on the level of detail and  resources committed to each phase. It is also possible to work on more than one step  at the same time. Considerations that can affect the time frame of the process are:   Availability of local agency staff and other stakeholders who will lead and/or  participate in the planning process.  Need for external support from consultants, community partners, or other external  partners to complete the process.  Data availability from internal and external providers and whether any new  technical studies are needed.  Commitment to community and stakeholder engagement (beyond those who  are leading the process), including types and timing of events and opportunities.  As discussed in Step 1.4, providing opportunities for stakeholder engagement can  be critical to ensuring the success of an adaptation planning project.   Requirements for review and participation by external agencies. Some planning  mechanisms, such as general plan safety elements or local hazard mitigation  plans, require review by external agencies that can take many months", "688": "Adaptation Capability Advancement Toolkit (ADAPT-CA)  ", "689": "WHAT IS THE BUDGET FOR THE PLANNING PROCESS? The budget should consider the needs of each phase, inclusive of the financial  resources to support stakeholder engagement. Budgets should include labor costs to  complete the work in addition to other costs, including equipment, meeting supplies,  materials, production, transportation, training, facility rental, and food for meetings. In  some cases, adaptation planning may require minimal additional financial resources  if existing staff can do all the work; however, in most cases, additional expertise is  needed to conduct all or parts of the process. If existing staff lead a new adaptation  planning process, it is important to ensure key staff have dedicated time in their  workload over the time frame of the process. If a capacity assessment determines  that existing staff resources are not available to lead an adaptation planning process,  the budget may need to cover hiring additional staff or external consultants, or  developing partnerships with regional collaboratives, university partners, or other  community-based or nongovernmental organizations. An inclusive and equitable  adaptation planning process includes the participation of community members and  stakeholders, and the budget should encompass the financial needs of a robust  outreach and engagement process that values community-based contributions. After  estimating the budget, determine if existing general funds or other dedicated internal  funds are available; if not, identify options for grants or external funding sources or  partnerships. Communities may also be able to receive low-cost or free assistance  from experts working pro bono or from a local university", "690": "WHO WILL BE ON THE PROJECT TEAM? The climate adaptation planning team provides institutional and technical knowledge  and often supports stakeholder outreach and engagement. As with any project, the  team should include a mix of people from relevant agencies and organizations with  a range of skills and responsibilities, but it should not be so big that management  and coordination become difficult. The project team should have a primary point  of contact or team leader who coordinates the process and team meetings. The  team leader should be empowered to make recommendations and/or have direct  access to decision-makers. If resources allow, the project team can be supported by  an advisory group with a larger membership to include representatives of partner  agencies and community organizations that provide subject matter expertise and  credibility to the process. If a consultant team is hired to support the process, it should  be involved in the project team as well", "691": "A project team often includes members of other departments under the same  organization. For example, if the planning department of a city government conducts  the adaptation planning effort, consider including members of the public works, parks  and recreation, police, public health, and building departments. If special districts 50 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate within the project boundaries play important roles, such as a fire protection district,  school district, or water district, consider including a representative from these districts  on the project team. Given the scale, pace, complexity, and uncertainty of climate  change impacts, adaptation planning necessitates inclusive, collaborative planning.  Significant coordination across departments, particularly for larger jurisdictions,  should occur when assessing vulnerabilities and developing, vetting, and prioritizing  adaptation strategies. Such coordination will not only result in a more meaningful and  comprehensive adaptation plan but can also help build staff capacity and buy-in for  adaptation initiatives.", "692": "Community-based organizations and institutions, such as hospitals and colleges,  may be part of a core project team. The core project team should also include  organizations representing or departments serving vulnerable populations in the  community. It should also be selective to reflect the community and include at least  one or more trusted community representatives. In some cases, it can make sense to  include representatives from applicable for-profit companies, such as utility companies  or major employers.", "693": "Teams integrating adaptation planning into local hazard mitigation planning should  include a comprehensive set of stakeholders from government departments, decision- making bodies, and regional or special districts. The following stakeholders should  have an opportunity to be part of the process:6  Local and regional agencies involved in hazard mitigation activities.

The easiest  way to start is to exclude climate change effects that are not expected in the defined  planning area. For example, a community in the high desert will probably not need to  include coastal hazards. With such a diverse environment throughout California, urban  and rural communities respectively face their own unique set of challenges due to  climate change. However, because climate change does not respect geographic boundaries,  hazards outside of a defined planning area may still be harmful to that planning June 2020 57 California Adaptation Planning Guide area. For instance, a wildfire can significantly impair regional air quality, block major  transportation routes, depress tourism, create refugees, and cause many other  impacts that extend beyond the burned area. Communities in the region may be  affected even if they have no wildfire-prone areas in their boundaries. It may be worth  including hazards that could affect areas of major regional employment or other large  economic drivers (such as state or national parks and forests), disrupt key infrastructure  (such as roads, rails, and power lines), or affect important resources that a community  relies on (such as snowpack that can affect water availability). If the adaptation planning effort is for a special district, such as a water provider  or park district, the number of climate changerelated effects may be smaller,  depending on the affected buildings, infrastructure, or resources. For example, ocean  acidification is likely not a hazard of concern for school districts, even those in coastal  communities.", "701": "WHAT ARE THE POPULATIONS AND ASSETS IN THE COMMUNITY? Climate change does not have the same effects in all parts of a community. Some  people and physical assets will be affected much more severely than others, and  adaptation planning efforts need to evaluate the full range of potential effects.  Communities should select the specific populations and assets to assess in order to  clearly understand how susceptible different people, places, and systems of the  community are to climate changerelated hazards and other effects. This allows 60 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate the community to develop adaptation  policies that respond to specific climate  vulnerabilities and build resiliency for the  most susceptible people and assets in the  community. Similar to identifying climate  change effects themselves, the goal here  is to compile a preliminary list of potential  populations and assets to help support  project scoping and the other steps of  this phase. The detailed vulnerability  assessment, including asset mapping, is  completed in Phase 2. What Is a Physical Asset? An asset is any feature of a  community that is not a person or  group of people. Assets include  the natural environment as well  as the built environment, such  as buildings and infrastructure  systems. Populations and assets are usually organized into a handful of categories or  sectors. For consistency with Safeguarding California and the California Adaptation  Clearinghouse, the APG organizes by 11 sectors:   Agriculture  Biodiversity and Habitat  Emergency Services  Energy  Forestry  Land Use and Community Development  Ocean and Coast Resources  Parks and Recreation   Public Health  Transportation  WaterJune 2020 61 California Adaptation Planning Guide Communities are free to use an organizing approach that better meets local needs.  For example, Placer County used the following categories in its adaptation planning  efforts for identifying populations and assets:7  Populations  Infrastructure  Buildings and Facilities  Economic Assets   Ecosystems  Services Regardless of how they are organized, virtually all people and assets in a community  will be affected by climate change in some way. However, it is not usually feasible to  assess the vulnerability of every population group or every asset in the community.  At the same time, adaptation planners should ensure that their assessment does  not exclude populations and assets that face greater harm or are critical to the  communitys well-being. When deciding which populations and assets to include,  consider these questions:  Is the population or asset likely to face substantive harm from climate-related  effects?  Is the population or asset likely susceptible to climate-related effects in a unique  way, different from most other populations or assets in the community?  If the population or asset is substantially harmed, are there significant  negative consequences to the community? Consider both direct and indirect  consequences and remember that consequences may not be evident until well  after the harm occurs.  Is the population or asset important to the community or other stakeholders?  Is the population or asset necessary to achieve overarching resiliency goals? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, the population or asset in question  should likely be included", "702": "People To help decide which groups of people to evaluate for climate-related susceptibility,  focus on populations who are likely to face the most harm from climate change. These  persons are sometimes said to be socially vulnerable or to have social vulnerability.  This does not mean that they lack resilient qualities. A person may be vulnerable to  climate-related consequences but have very strong social networks and community  involvement, which improve individual resiliency. It also does not mean that they are 62 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate responsible for their vulnerability or that they could have made different choices  that would have improved their resiliency. Many socially vulnerable people have  historically faced, and continue to face, systemic social, economic, and political  marginalization and injustice. By identifying groups that are socially vulnerable,  communities acknowledge the systemic discrimination that many such persons  have faced and seek to correct these wrongs and build resiliency in a manner that is  equitable and just. There are many reasons why some groups of people are more susceptible to climate- related hazardslimited access to financial resources, health challenges or disabilities  (physical, cognitive, behavioral, and all other forms), living or working conditions that  result in greater exposure to hazard events, physical or social isolation, historical and  current marginalization or deprivation of resources, and reduced agency or ability to  make decisions. These are all factors that can lead to a greater potential for harm,  and many people fall into more than one category. When selecting populations for an adaptation planning effort, consider the underlying  factors that contribute to a group being potentially susceptible. It may help to  combine populations that have similar root issues, are likely to face similar levels  of vulnerability and may benefit from similar adaptation solutions. For example, it  might make more sense for a community to assess low-income households (<80  percent of area median income), very low-income households (<50 percent), and  extremely low-income households (<30 percent) in one category. Other communities  might benefit from evaluating these three groups separately. A group of potentially  susceptible people should not be excluded simply because it represents a small  percentage of the total population. However, it may not be possible to accurately  assess the vulnerability of a very small number of people. If there are extremely  small groups who should be included in the adaptation planning efforts, consider  combining them with another group, as appropriate. Examples of potential populations to include are:8  Chronically ill persons, including those with compromised immune systems  Foster children  Incarcerated persons  Linguistically isolated persons  Low-income persons  Persons experiencing homelessness  Persons in designated disadvantaged communities  Persons in overcrowded households  Persons with disabilitiesJune 2020 63 California Adaptation Planning Guide  Persons without access to lifelines  Persons working outdoors, including farmworkers  Persons working in industries that may be subject to transition or elimination as a  result of climate change   Renters  Senior citizens, especially those living alone  Single female heads of households  Students  Tribal communities  Undocumented persons  Visitors and seasonal residents  Young children For more guidance on selecting populations for climate adaptation planning, and to  foster equity in implementation, see the Vulnerable Populations and Equity Checklist  appendices of Planning and Investing for a Resilient California and the ICARP guide,  Defining Vulnerable Communities in the Context of Climate Adaptation.", "703": "Built Assets There are many reasons to include built assets (buildings, infrastructure systems, developed  land uses, important economic drivers, etc.) in an adaptation planning effort. Some  built assets are used daily by a large percentage of the population and their damage  or loss would significantly disrupt community members. Some built assets provide  important services, such as delivering water or electricity. Some employ many people  in the community or attract large numbers of visitors, and the community would face  economic hardship if the asset had to limit its operations or close. Other built assets, such  as local landmarks or historically/culturally significant locations, may not provide tangible  benefits but are a source of community pride. Also, consider built assets not only for  their day-to-day performance, but for their value during or after a major emergency.  For example, people may not think of their local community hall or recreation center as  a critical asset, but during emergency events, these buildings can be assembly points,  shelters, and bases of operations for response and recovery operations.  When developing the individual categories of built assets, consider whether similar  assets should be grouped together or evaluated separately. It may make sense  to evaluate separately very important assets or those whose loss would be highly  disruptive. For example, communities can generally group roadways into one  category, but it may make sense to evaluate each major roadway or highway  individually. If a handful of similar built assets face different potential harms (for 64 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate example, multiple hospitals or wastewater treatment plants in different parts of the  community that are exposed to different climate-related hazards), it might also be  helpful to evaluate these separately. Consider whether it is helpful to evaluate the service a built asset provides separately  from the buildings or infrastructure that provide the service. Although they seem  related, the two could experience different degrees of vulnerability to natural hazards  and require different adaptation solutions. For example, a drought can significantly  affect water deliveries in the community, even if it causes no physical damage to the  water infrastructure. A hospital might survive a severe storm event with no damage or  loss of capacity, but emergency medical response service can be harmed by blocked  or damaged roadways. Examples of potential built asset categories are:  Airports  Bridges and tunnels  Communication systems and service  Community facilities (recreation centers, libraries, senior centers, etc.)  Power lines, natural gas pipes, water lines, and related services  Flood control infrastructure  Goods movement  Government offices and government continuity  Grocery stores  Major employers and economic sectors  Major roads and highways, especially evacuation routes  Medical facilities  Parks  Power plants  Public safety service  Rail lines  Schools, including colleges and universities  Transit stops", "704": "Natural and Managed Resource Assets These assets include natural ecosystems as well as assets that seem natural but are  closely controlled by humans, such as agricultural lands and managed timberlands.  They can include the land or water itself, the plant and animal communities that June 2020 65 California Adaptation Planning Guide live there, and less tangible benefits such as healthy biodiversity. Paleontological or  geological resources could also be included in this category, including those that are  extracted for economic benefits. There are many reasons to include natural and managed resource assets. First and  foremost, many of these assets are defining characteristics of the community and  the region and are considered invaluable to the people who live there. In a state  with such diverse and prized natural systems, natural and managed resource assets  can have tremendous symbolic value and be an enormous source of pride. In many  communities, these assets directly or indirectly employ large numbers of people  in recreation, tourist-serving activities, agriculture and food processing, and other  economic sectors. Natural and managed resource assets can also provide critical  ecosystem services, such as dunes and wetlands that help buffer coastal communities  from storm surges and high tides. Examples of potential natural and managed resource assets are:  Beaches  Chaparral  Endangered, threatened, and sensitive species  Farms, orchards, and vineyards  Forests  Greenbelts  Hiking and biking trails  Historic and cultural resource areas  Keystone species  Lakes and rivers  Livestock  Meadows and grasslands  Metal, stone, petroleum, and other extracted resources  Pastures  Scenic views or ridgelines  State and national parks, forests, wilderness areas, and other protected locations  Timber resources  Wetlands  Wildlife corridors", "705": "The APG recommends integrating  community outreach and engagement  into all phases of the adaptation planning  process. This will build trust between the  core planning team and community  stakeholders and develop a plan that  has collective support. Outreach and  engagement should be considered  carefully and budgeted appropriately.  The approach should include  stakeholders within the organization or  agency leading the adaptation planning  process, and those external to the  organization or agency.", "706": "Additionally, it is helpful if all members of the core planning team are trained in  outreach before engaging stakeholders. Topics such as cultural humility, racism, and  systems of injustice are issues that some may not be used to addressing in relation  to climate risk, but it is critical to understand those power dynamics when working  with vulnerable populations. For example, Figure 7 shows how populations deal with  underlying structural root causes, social factors, and biological factors that could  contribute to increased sensitivity to climate change. Understanding these causes  and factors before the outreach process helps create avenues of communication and  builds trust between the project team and the community", "707": "After assembling the core planning team, it is essential to enlist residents, businesses,  students, and other community groups because they have knowledge, information,  and ideas that local governments may not know or anticipate. Community members  most affected by climate issues can collaborate on solutions, which can result in more  effective implementation. It is key to empower community member that they have a  sense of co-ownership in the planning process.", "708": "The project team and/or consultant should prepare an approach or plan for  community and stakeholder engagement, with support from the advisory group if one  is assembled. The plan can be simple, brief, and flexible to adapt over time. Ideally, as  noted in the Regional Resilience Toolkit, the outreach and engagement plan should:  Identify stakeholders (stakeholder mapping is one method).   Determine culturally specific outreach needs and strategies.  Link planning and outreach messages to community values and needs.  Develop outreach goals for each stakeholder group and the broader community.  Establish how to engage individuals and groups best and specify objectives and  roles.  Define the specific methods to most effectively engage each group: in a  meeting, via digital communications, one-on-one, or through partners or other  groups.  Detail how these activities will integrate with other planning efforts.  Determine need, objectives, and composition for an advisory group.  Determine the focus and purpose of each event, meeting, and input opportunity.  Provide a schedule with objectives and roles for each activity.14 The Regional Resilience Toolkit includes a sample outline for outreach and  engagement plan and tools and worksheets to support outreach tools, materials,  activities, and meetings.", "709": "PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS  Local agencies can engage  with the business community to  support adaptation planning and  implementation. Protecting a healthy  local economy is a critical part of  maintaining a communitys long-term  resilience, and many businesses recognize  the threat that climate change may pose  to their activities and financial health.  Businesses also can provide increased  investments and other resources that may  not always be available to individual  communities. This creates opportunities  for businesses and local governments to  join or create public-private partnership  to address resilience issues. Opportunities  for public-private partnerships include  creating an economic working group  or advisory body, establishing training  and capacity-building opportunities  such as resilience or continuity planning  workshops, and setting adaptation  standards for permitting new private  developments. Communities can  join with local businesses as well as  larger companies that may be able  to meaningfully contribute to local  efforts. Local governments should  consider how best to use public-private  partnerships to support comprehensive  community adaptation efforts, because  businesses may be able to bolster resilience for other stakeholders and members of  the community. Local governments can consider how best to weigh the needs of  businesses along with the requirements of other community members.", "710": "STAKEHOLDER MAPPING  The engagement process should be inclusive and multidisciplinary. It should  include people at varying levels of authority, including those empowered to  make recommendations and decisions and representatives of governmental and  nongovernmental organizations. Stakeholder identification and mapping supports an  equitable outreach and engagement approach. Stakeholder mapping is the process  of visualizing relationships and prioritizing engagement efforts through understanding  perspectives and interests in the community. The Regional Resilience Toolkit includes  template worksheets to do this.16 For each stakeholder, the project team should  decide who should be involved; what their role will be in the process and the plan  implementation; and how, when, and how often they should be engaged (see  Figure 8). Furthermore, stakeholder mapping should list vulnerable populations to assess how  they will be involved. As mentioned in Step 1.3, vulnerable populations can include  chronically ill persons, foster children, incarcerated persons, linguistically isolated  persons, low-income persons, persons experiencing homelessness, persons in  designated disadvantaged communities, persons in overcrowded households, persons  with disabilities, persons without access to lifelines, renters, senior citizens, single female  heads of households, students, tribal communities, undocumented persons, visitors  and seasonal residents, and young children", "711": "CREATING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES Keeping stakeholder mapping in mind is important for each outreach and  engagement activity. Moreover, the core planning team should determine what they  are trying to achieve and help manage what the public should expect. It is helpful to  think of each outreach and engagement activity as part of a spectrum. See Table 7  for the International Association of Public Participation (IAP2) Spectrum.17, 18 The IAP2 spectrum is a theoretical model for varying levels of participation and  engagement and is not a specific recommendation for any one set of activities or  goals. Local agencies and communities need to decide what level of engagement is  appropriate to facilitate community participation in decision-making.  Core activities and characteristics necessary to building a diligent and robust public  engagement process include:  Providing educational opportunities.  Soliciting community input.  Maintaining a direct method of communication with the community specifically  for the climate adaptation planning effort.  Outreach can include, but is not limited to, meetings for specific topics or geographic  areas, online engagement, roundtables, forums, community festivals, workshops, or  pop-up events.", "712": "This guidance uses the latest and best available knowledge from state and federal  resources about designing and completing vulnerability studies. The approach is  designed to ensure that the resulting vulnerability assessment meets Safety Element  requirements in California Government Code  65302(g)(4), as updated by SB 379  and SB 1035. It is also designed so that users can easily integrate the vulnerability  assessment into a local hazard mitigation plan (LHMP). This approach to a vulnerability  assessment mostly aligns with FEMAs risk assessment process in Task 5 of Local  Mitigation Planning Handbook, and the APG notes when this is the case.

Projection data is also accessible through Cal-Adapt. Cal-Adapt and other sources  present a range of projection scenarios and climate models for different effects.  Considering a range of scenarios and models can help staff think through variations in  the severity of climate change effects and account for projection uncertainties.

Therefore, when  retrieving projections, it is helpful to select the appropriate parameters for local  circumstances.  ", "725": "Selecting emission scenarios. GHG emissions scenarios reflect different projections  for how global emissions and atmospheric GHG concentrations may change over  time. The latest scenarios are representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and  Cal-Adapt provides projections for a low emissions scenario (RCP 4.5) and a high  emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). The Governors Office of Planning and Research (OPR)  recommends that agencies use RCP 8.5 for analyses considering impacts through  2050 because there are minimal differences between emissions scenarios during  the first half of the century.1  For analyses considering impacts beyond 2050, OPR  recommends selecting warming scenarios on a case-by-case basis. For a more  conservative approach to a given community element, consider using only RCP 8.5.  For a less conservative approach, use both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Which approach  will be most useful in selecting emissions scenarios depends on a given community  elements risk and criticality. ", "726": "Selecting climate models. For each GHG emissions scenario, retrieve projections from  a range of global climate models (GCMs), which vary based on the different modeling  assumptions. The most current GCMs come from the Coupled Model Intercomparison  Project, version 5 (CMIP-5), developed to support the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change. Though using all 32 CMIP 5 GCMs is ideal for a comprehensive assessment,  there are subsets of 10 and 4 GCMs that closely simulate Californias climate and can  be used in studies that cannot accommodate all 32 models.2, 3  Cal-Adapts default  settings provide outputs for these subsets of 10 and 4 models, depending on the hazard.4 Considering a range of climate model outputsin addition to an ensemble average can be helpful in getting a fuller picture of potential future conditions. State guidance,  including from the Safeguarding California Plan and the California Ocean Protection  Council, recommends evaluating a range of future climate scenarios appropriate for  planning decisions and respective risk aversion level. For example, high-end scenarios  (e.g., H++ scenario for sea-level rise) are recommended for use with high-stakes decisions  where underaccounting for projected changes could lead to significant financial or  environmental impacts or public health and safety consequences. It is also important to retrieve climate projections for the appropriate time frame. After  selecting the historical baseline and future time horizon of interest, pull climate data  for a multi-decade period (usually 20 or 30 years) centered on the year of interest. For  example, if the year of interest is 2050, consider pulling projections for 2040 to 2060 or  2036 to 2065. Cal-Adapt uses 1961 to 1990 as the default baseline period; 1986 to 2005  is another common baseline period. Multidecade averages account for interannual  variability and appropriately characterize the climate norm for the selected historical  context and future time horizon.5", "727": "TEP 2.1D: MAP HAZARDS AND OTHER CLIMATE CHANGERELATED EFFECTS Mapping climate projection data helps with visualizing the populations and assets  that are projected to be exposed to the effects of climate change. Depending on a  communitys needs and staff capacity, some mapping options are printed maps, free  computer mapping tools like Google Maps, or dedicated Geographic Information  Systems (GIS). In cases where mapping is not particularly informative, other methods for visualizing  climate trends can be relevant to a community. For example, consider projecting  the frequency of heat waves (i.e., multiple extreme heat days over a given threshold)  over the Step 2.1c time horizons, and see how this frequency changes over time.  Cal-Adapt includes a variety of visualizations to inform an exposure analysis and has  downloadable data to allow visualizations in other software (e.g., Excel charts). In some cases, quantitative datasets are not available for relevant hazards. In this case,  it is still useful to provide a narrative description of how (and whether) exposure varies  across the community, and the degree to which community assets are projected to  be exposed. For example, although there are spatial datasets showing todays inland  flooding and landslide risks, there are not widely available spatial datasets related to  future inland flooding and landslide risks. For these hazards, it is still useful to explain  how risks may change in the future due to changes in climate. Accessing Climate Hazard Projection Data with Cal-Adapt Cal-Adapt is an online resource that provides quick and easy access to  downscaled climate project data. An array of climate models and emissions  scenarios offer climate projections for the major stressors facing California,  including: Temperature averages and extremes Precipitation averages and extremes Sea-level rise Wildfires Drought Cal-Adapt provides users with easily accessible projections and more detailed  downloadable data to support a range of needs.88 Phase 2: Assess Vulnerability For more detailed mapping, GIS data sources for climate hazard projections include:  Coastal hazards. Sea the Future is a good resource for understanding the various  sea level rise and flood visualization tools available. While there are a number  of options, all with their own benefits and limitations, organizations may wish to  consider two in particular. The US Geological Surveys Coastal Storm Modeling  System (CoSMoS) has maps of coastal flooding under various sea level rise  scenarios, storm conditions, and erosion. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the  Adapting to Rising Tides (ART) program has detailed sea level rise mapping for  several different scenarios. Unlike other sea level rise mapping programs, CoSMoS  and ART programs provide both sea level rise and coastal storm scenarios on  a simple online platform without the need for specialized software. Both also  provide detailed information that is not always available from other mapping  sources.  Temperature, precipitation, hydrologic variables, and wildfires. Cal-Adapts  downloadable data is available in NetCDF, TIFF, and other formats. If the planning team has GIS capabilities, it can overlay these climate change effect  projections with community assets. Consider mapping climate change effects with  utility assets, transportation assets, hospitals, telecommunication assets, public spaces,  populations, and other assets. Another option is to map climate change effects with  indices of social vulnerabilitysuch as CalEnviroScreen and Healthy Places Indexto  learn more about projected exposure in disadvantaged communities", "728": "Step 2.2: Sensitivity and Potential Impacts The goal of Step 2.2 is to characterize  past and potential future climate impacts  to community populations and assets.

Climate change will also generate  impacts that may be entirely new to  some communities. However, examining  historical climate impacts is useful  for establishing context and better  understanding present-day vulnerability.  As a result, in this step, consider both  historical and projected impacts by  collecting information on past impacts  and augmenting this with more forward- looking information. Specifically: 1. Conduct desk research on historical  climate impacts.  2. Conduct desk research on potential future climate impacts.  3.

A broad scope of assets can dilute the focus of the vulnerability  assessment and create less-actionable outcomes. A more limited scope allows more  concentrated effort on later stepssuch as Phase 3 and Phase 4that focus on  mitigating impacts.

Loss of housing (e.g., loss of areas available for housing, loss of existing limited  housing stock, including affordable housing generally and specifically in  communities experiencing significant housing shortages).  Disruptions to a transportation system that can affect accessibility to some areas,  or that can adversely affect drive or ride times (e.g., a landslide or flood that  temporarily closes off access to an area; increased transit time on buses during  precipitation events; floods or wildfires that shut down transit stops or lines).

This will aid in assessing how well the community is prepared to  deal with the problem now (adaptive capacity) and aid in developing new policy  and strategies. Underlying data and analysis should also be preserved and made  available, but the problem statements allow everyone to work from a basic, common  understanding.", "748": "After completing the assessment of climate changerelated effects, summarize the  findings to identify the most significant potential for harm in the community. These  findings or problem statements will help to craft effective strategies and actions.  Problem statements will help to:  Communicate critical planning issues, for example, which critical assets are  particularly vulnerable, what areas currently have repetitive losses, or how many  high hazard areas are currently zoned for future development.  Assist the community and stakeholders to prioritize and focus on the areas that  have the greatest need for mitigation or adaptation based on the assessment of  climate changerelated effects.  Create a clear and cogent story to help support decision-making by elected  officials and other stakeholders.  Provide a foundation for seeking funds to reduce the potential for harm and  increase community resilience.", "749": "CONFIRM VISION The objective of this step is to confirm the communitys vision for adaptation and  resilience. It should engage stakeholders, the project team, and decision makers.  Phase 1 included preparation of a vision or definition of what adaptation and  resilience means to the community. In Phase 3, a review of the vision will help frame  how to address the issues in the vulnerability assessment. If the community did not  prepare a vision statement during Phase 1, this is a good time to do so.", "750": "RAFT GOALS Goals provide direction for achieving a vision and act as guideposts throughout the  planning process and implementation. As noted in the Regional Resilience Toolkit, 2 establishing resilience goals assists in:  Building transparency into the process at the outset so that all participants  understand the breadth of priorities and topics to cover.  Engaging the project team and stakeholders early in deciding what shared  outcomes they will work cooperatively to achieve and providing an opportunity  for input and feedback on the project direction.  Providing a foundation upon which future project decisions can be made and  help in evaluating how well mitigation actions will meet established community  values and expectations.  Connecting to metrics and tracking and monitoring progress of the project  through implementation.110 Phase 3: Define Adaptation Framework and Strategies Goals may be driven by a desire to protect:3  Physical areas (e.g., new development along the shoreline, natural resource areas  or assets)  Asset classes (e.g., infrastructure, natural resources)  Social values (e.g., protecting parks because beauty and recreation are highly  held values)  Economic values (e.g., protecting major economic drivers like large businesses)  Character, history, sense of place (e.g., protecting historic structures or  neighborhoods)  Existing functions/activities (e.g., emergency services)  Specific communities (e.g., vulnerable populations) To get started, group the problem statements from Step 3.1 by themes, such as climate  change effects, populations and assets at risk, or sectors. Several problem statements  or groups may lead to a single adaptation goal. The APG uses 11 sectors (see Figure 4)  to support organization of example strategies, which are defined in Appendix A.  Communities can use the same sectors or follow an organizational approach that best  fits their implementation needs. When drafting goals, it is important to start with a review of existing goals in the  communitys planning documentse.g., general plan and LHMPand state plans  such as Safeguarding California and the State Hazard Mitigation Plan. This review  will help the project team determine if existing community goals support the vision,  respond to the vulnerability assessment and will support integration and alignment of  adaptation and resilience goals. Goals that respond to the vulnerability assessment, such as those that seek to increase  adaptive capacity, protect assets, and reduce impacts from hazards and other  climate change effects, help other stakeholders see how resilience fits with existing  community priorities. Goals should be clear and accessible to all stakeholders, and  they should reduce or avoid long-term vulnerabilities. The goals will be supported by  strategies developed in Step 3.3.  The General Plan Guidelines (2017) define a goal as a general direction-setter. It is  an ideal future end related to the public health, safety, or general welfare. A goal is a  general expression of community values and may be abstract in nature. It may not be  quantifiable or time dependent.4 The FEMA Local Mitigation Handbook describes goals as general guidelines that  explain what the community wants to achieve with the plan. They are usually broad, June 2020 111 California Adaptation Planning Guide policy-type statements that are long term, and they represent visions for reducing or  avoiding losses from the identified hazards.5 Goals should be designed with consideration to how progress can be tracked or  monitored. Some communities may prepare one or more objective statement for  each goal. These objective statements are meant to be specifically measurable  in some way that shows progress toward the goal. For example, a goal to reduce  community vulnerability to wildfires might have objectives for the percentage of  homes that meet defensible space best practices. Whether specific objective  statements are prepared or not, the goal and strategy development process should  proceed with consideration to developing specific indicators of progress that can be  monitored", "751": "Strategy development is iterative, especially in an inclusive and transparent  process with the community. The initial round of strategy development could be a  brainstorming activity that results in lists of ideas that can be revised later in response  to more stakeholder feedback, and to fit the structure and requirements of the  implementation mechanism. Developing strategies with agency and community  stakeholders identifies opportunities to integrate adaptation planning into multiple  community programs and plans.", "752": "It is common to categorize strategies to respond to different options for  implementation. The Regional Resilience Toolkit10 provides examples of strategy  categories or types that have been incorporated into the example strategies in  Appendix C. These categories include operational; programmatic; plans, regulations,  and policy development; capital improvement/infrastructure projects; education,  outreach, and coordination; and evaluation.11  Programmatic. Strategies to expand or create new programs, activities, and  initiatives.  Plans, regulations, and policy development. Strategies to develop or revise  policies, plans, regulations, and guidelines.  Capital improvement/infrastructure projects. Strategies designed to address  physical and functional deficiencies and needs in the built and natural  environment.  Education/outreach/coordination. Strategies related to initiating or expanding  partnerships and relationships, communicating and sharing information, and  expanding awareness.  Evaluation. Strategies to improve feedback, input, and data and information or  conduct further or new analyses.", "753": "Step 3.4: Prioritize Adaptation Strategies In Step 3.3 the project team and community developed adaptation strategies based  on the vulnerability assessment and community engagement (see Section 3.5,  Conduct Outreach and Engagement). In this step the project team should prioritize  those adaptation strategies. This will aid in making decisions about complex issues,  and it will make the strategy development process transparent and easier to  communicate to community staff and residents. Prioritization of strategies should  consider several factors:  Vulnerability Score (from Step 2.4). Which strategies will be effective at addressing  assets or systems with the highest vulnerability?  Administrative Operability. Who will implement the strategy and what is their  organizational capacity?  Cost. How much will the strategy cost to implement?  Funding. What resources are available to pay for implementation?  Bond funding. (e.g., LA Countys Measure W, California Prop 68), tax programs  (e.g., Bay Areas Measure AA, tax-increment financing), public-private  partnerships, and others as summarized in Phase 4.  Effectiveness/Benefit. How effective is the strategy at addressing the problem  and/or what is the benefit? What future losses might be avoided?  Efficiency. How do the costs compare to the effectiveness/benefit? (What is  the benefit-cost ratio?) What are direct and additional indirect benefits of the  strategy?  Co-benefits. What are the co-benefits of the strategy?  Environmental Performance. What are the potential environmental impacts or  considerations of implementing the strategy? Does the strategy support nature- based approaches and natural systems?  Equity. Who pays the cost and who receives the benefits (including co-benefits)?  Legality. Is the strategy consistent with applicable laws?  Responsiveness/Appropriateness. How responsive or appropriate is the strategy to  the needs and conditions of everyone in the community, especially those on the  frontline?  Timing. When will implementation begin and how long will it take?  Monitoring. How will the strategy be tracked and monitored for effectiveness? Is  there a key performance indicator?", "754": "Cost/Benefit Assessment for Adaptation Actions The two resources below illustrate ways in which communities can assess  and balance the benefits associated with adaptation actions and the costs.  Balancing these is critical to communities to achieve the most effective and  implementable outcomes. Using a NOAA framework, the San Diego Regional Climate Collaborative  compared the trade-offs (cost vs. benefits) of various coastal adaptation  strategies. This assessment evaluated the utility of the NOAA Framework  and demonstrated the outcomes for two southern California cities. The  outcomes balanced costs of the strategies against the potential losses  associated with various scenarios.19 In Economic Analysis of Nature-Based Adaptation to Climate Change:  Ventura County, California, the Nature Conservancy assessed the potential  costs and benefits of engineered measures (coastal armoring) compared  to nature-based adaptation measures. The Nature Conservancys  publication summarizes the evaluation methods and the findings as an  example to other jurisdictions. This type of analysis gives a community  insight into the reasoning behind actions to address sea level rise.20", "755": "The Regional Resilience Toolkit suggests looking at four frames when prioritizing  strategies:21  Society and equity.

One way to help with this would be to summarize and visually illustrate  aspects of each strategy, which could include:  A cost or feasibility estimate  A list of co-benefits, including equity implications  Downsides to adopting the strategy  Potential barriers or challenges  Implementation needs  Case study or example  Other important information from Step 3.4", "758": "Step 4.1: Implement In Phase 1, Step 1.1, the project team identified the end product or plan of the  adaptation planning process. Phase 1 also presented the types of plans, programs,  and implementation mechanisms common in adaptation planning. In Phase 3, the  project team developed and prioritized adaptation strategies. Development of June 2020 137 California Adaptation Planning Guide adaptation strategies likely included identification of a potential lead department  and/or partners tasked to implement a strategy, a time frame for implementation, and  potential cost estimates. When starting Phase 4 and implementation, the first step is to  prepare an implementation program and to confirm the implementation mechanism  and responsible department of entity needed for each adaptation strategy. Some  strategies will be implemented upon adoption of the plan prepared as a result of the  adaptation planning process, while others will need to be further developed and/or  be integrated into other plans or programs. All adaptation strategies have temporal components that include time to implementation,  timing of necessary action, and duration of effectiveness. These elements of time must be  considered for all strategies and when devising the method of measure delivery. For implementation strategies that will be further developed or implemented, the  team should identify the planning document or other mechanism best suited to drive  strategy implementation, as well as any documents that should be amended to ensure  consistency. The answers to two questions can help clarify the choice of mechanism: 1. Which mechanism most closely overlaps the intent and topic area of a strategy? 2. Which mechanism is next slated for update or revision?", "759": "Regardless of how they are implemented, adaptation strategies tend to be in more than  one plan, such as the general plan, local hazard mitigation plan (LHMP), climate action or  sustainability plan, integrated regional water management plan, and capital investment  plan. Other possible mechanisms for adaptation strategies are discussed in Phase 1.  General plans. In 2017, OPR released updated General Plan Guidelines. These  guidelines are a resource for understanding where climate adaptation strategies  are best integrated into a general plan. Climate adaptation influences content  in all chapters of a general plan; however, the element that often holds the most  adaptation content is the safety or comparable element. Other elements of the  general plan, including optional elements such as an equitable and resilient  communities element, may also have adaptation content.1   The safety element is the primary location for addressing climate-exacerbated  hazards and climate change impacts. This includes identifying community  vulnerabilities associated with climate change (see the vulnerability assessment  described in Phase 2) and developing strategies to address these vulnerabilities  (Phase 3). The safety element should include a vulnerability assessment or a  reference to where it is in another document. This element in particular must  be consistent with the LHMP if the community has one. It also needs to be  consistent with other elements of the general plan, such as land use, circulation,  housing, conservation, air quality, and environmental justice.138 Phase 4: Implement, Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust   The land use element includes  the planned future pattern of all  community land uses and can  include policy language that  reduces the vulnerability of existing  and new development.   A circulation element can include  policies ensuring appropriate  ingress and egress for all  neighborhoods and that major  circulation corridors are not  endangered by climate impacts  and addressing other mobility- related vulnerabilities.   Housing element policies ensure  that all residential land use by  type, location, and building  standards are resilient to heat,  poor air quality, and all other  potential climate impacts. These  policies can also address the  availability of housing and the  vulnerabilities of persons who are  susceptible to climate change due  to their living situation. The California Department of Housing and Community  Development (HCD) has an abundance of technical assistance available to  local governments.   The conservation and open space elements include strategies to protect  vulnerable ecosystems (habitat, sensitive and endangered species, other  flora and fauna). They may also include policies to reduce vulnerabilities from  hazards in natural areas (e.g., fire).   The air quality element can address vulnerabilities from climate-influenced  pollutants. For example, this optional element could address vulnerabilities  from increased ozone due to warmer temperatures, and issues from increased  particulate matter associated with drought or fire.   The environmental justice element or content can specifically acknowledge  that some subpopulations in a community are disproportionately vulnerable to  climate impacts, particularly with respect to health outcomes. This element or  content area relates to many other elements in the general plan. City of Hermosa Beach  General Plan and  Climate Change The City of Hermosa Beach  General Plan, adopted in 2017,  has a section in the safety  element focused on climate  change impacts and adaptation.  This section addresses sea level  rise, extreme heat, and other  potential impacts, such as public  health, precipitation, water,  biological resources, agriculture,  marine resources, and energy. The  plan includes potential impacts  of projected climate change  and strategies to ensure the city is  prepared for them. 2June 2020 139 California Adaptation Planning Guide  Local hazard mitigation plans. LHMPs  include both long-term and short-term  hazard mitigation planning. They can  include discussion of emergency  preparation and response, such as  notification systems and available  resources for emergency response  activities. These plans also should  ensure that communities are  prepared for escalating climate  vulnerabilities. The LHMP should be  consistent with a communitys general  plan safety element.  Climate action plans/sustainability  plans. Climate action plans (CAPs)  or sustainability plans are broad  strategic plans to address climate  change or sustainability. They do  not have a standard structure or  form, unlike other mechanisms such  as general plans. Climate change  adaptation is often a component,  although some may focus only on  greenhouse gas reductions. They  may include or refer to a vulnerability  assessment (Phase 2). Some of their  strategies often overlap with the  general plan, LHMP, and other plans  such as a bike and pedestrian plan.  Many CAPs and related documents  discuss implementation issues,  including assigning responsible  entities, funding, and indicators for  monitoring.", "760": "Integrated regional water management plans. Integrated regional water  management (IRWM) plans address water concerns at a regional level. SB 1672 (2002)  requires IRWM plans that address water supply and quality, flood protection, and other  matters. The California Department of Water Resources IRWM planning guidelines  require the inclusion of climate change considerations in IRWM planning analyses.  In an effort to assist practitioners, the Department of Water Resources developed a  listing of climate change documents relevant to IRWM planning. The regional-level  assessment, oversight, and strategies can deliver higher value investments and balance  priorities among multiple jurisdictions. This is particularly important in settings such as  the California Delta Ecosystem or the Salton Sea, where watershed issues fall under the  authority of several local, regional, and state agencies.  Capital improvement planning. A local governments capital improvement plan  is an annual or biennial plan for financing community projects and is typically  what funds community assets or infrastructure, such as bridges, water treatment  facilities, or community centers and smaller projects such as new bike lanes or  sidewalks. These projects may be directly vulnerable to climate hazards, may  serve as shelters or gathering places or may provide evacuation routes during  emergency situations. Having local community facilities and infrastructure that  are climate resilient bolsters local adaptive capacity. In addition, integrating  adaptation into the planning and design efforts for public projects nearly always  saves a community money through avoided losses, even if the up-front costs of a  new location or additional structural measures are slightly higher.5 Climate-resilient  features may also reduce regular maintenance and operation costs of some  facilities (such as rooftop solar panels).  ", "761": "Adaptation strategies, regardless of the plan or program that contains them, need  to be implemented to achieve their intended outcome. This requires assigning  staff, developing programs or other measures, securing funding, and engaging the  public. Many of these choices are described in Phase 3. It is important to confirm the  remaining details to implement the strategy. This process builds on the prioritization  of adaptation needs and strategies in previous phases, and outreach and funding  are covered in subsequent sections. The way to implement adaptation actions will  vary by location and jurisdictional context. Things to consider when developing the  implementation approach are:6, 7  Build on existing processes. Building on actions already proven effective in a  community is a great place to start. Ideally, pursuit of this concept began in  Phase 3, but further implementation includes integrating strategies into programs  already in place from another plan, such as the general plan or LHMP. Bolstering  or altering existing programs builds on internal strengths. Staff may already be June 2020 141 California Adaptation Planning Guide familiar with a particular type of  policy or program, cutting down  on training, the startup time, and  associated costs.  Assess cost-effectiveness. The  project team should evaluate each  implementation method for cost,  down to the department and staffing  requirements. This process also begins  in earlier phases, such as Phase 3, but  has a role here. In situations where  multiple implementation options can  achieve the same adaptation goal,  cost/benefit assessment is a way to  compare measures to determine  the most cost-effective option or a  sequence of measures that starts  with the most fiscally feasible but  potentially lower adaptation benefit  in the short term. At its simplest, such  an assessment looks at whether  or not an action can be funded  on an ongoing basis through the  general fund. This case can be  bolstered in when implementation  yields future cost savings, offsetting  the implementation cost. Strategies  such as altering the building code  for cooler (lighter color) roofs is an  example that does not impose  high costs directly on the local  government. Other actions may be  funded with establishment of a new  fee system. Larger, structural projects  are often funded through bonds.  The measures that are more difficult  to implement rely most on external  funding or financing. In many cases,  this is the most feasible option, but  also the most tenuous.  City of Chula Vista Cost  Effective Measures  Chula Vista, through use of the  Climate Change Working Group  (CCWG), adopted adaptation  actions in 2011. The CCWG was  made up of residents, businesses,  and community representatives.  In collaboration with city staff, this  group brainstormed a lengthy list  of potential measures, which it  ultimately trimmed to 11 based on  factors such as local jurisdictional  authority and cost considerations.  These considerations resulted  in nearly all of the 11 actions  being implemented. One such  success was cool roofs. The  CCWG recommended and city  staff implemented a new cool  roof ordinance. The measure  was estimated to cost less than  $30,000, an amount deemed  feasible for the city budget.8, 9142 Phase 4: Implement, Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust  Leverage community and  private sector alliances. Aligning  strategies with local community  groups and private sector entities  is a good way to ensure ongoing  effectiveness. It also is a way to  limit cost burden by delegating  aspects of implementation to an  external entity. This can be formally  established with an MOU or a similar  formal partnership agreement. The  following section describes outreach  specifically, a critical part of ensuring  that adaptation benefits are shared  in all parts of a community and that  the actions bolster social equity.  Establish partnerships regionally. Geographic boundaries should  not constrain adaptive actions,  and some adaptive actions require  regional collaboration. Regional  compacts or less formal partnerships  with regional entities can assist  communities with technical  assistance and potential funding.  Regional partnerships also are a  good way to engage in peer-to-peer  learning with communities that share  similar challenges. The Alliance of  Regional Collaboratives for Climate  Adaptation provides the context  for many parts of the state to foster  learning, allow for collaborative  pursuit of funding opportunities, and  develop private sector adaptation  support. 10", "762": "IMPLEMENTATION OUTREACH When the adaptation planning is complete and the plan is approved, the transition  to implementation can be celebrated with a fun, public event. Such an event is an  opportunity to honor stakeholders and their role in the process and is the next step  of implementation. The event should be planned with those already engaged in the  process, but this is also an opportunity to identify stakeholders that have not been  involved and could be important voices and partners during implementation. This  includes communities most likely impacted by one or more points of vulnerability or  affected by the strategies that have been prioritized for implementation. Implementation strategies can and should build on the actions recommended in  Phase 3. In this case, rather than asking community members to help brainstorm  adaptation measures, community members can be asked for help supporting and  bolstering implementation and supporting monitoring. During engagement, the  project team can share ongoing progress of adaptation actions and their resulting  benefits. Communities can be sought in the following roles:  Collaborators in education.  Participants and facilitators of tours of adaptation projects as they are implemented.  Recipients of surveys to assess effectiveness and social acceptance.  Receptors or generators of online updates of adaptation progress.  Participants or leaders of pop-up booths at locations illustrating adaptive action  or community events.  Communities can ensure ongoing support for adaptation by maintaining outreach  efforts. Climate adaptation requires ongoing, long-term commitment despite the  changes in elected leaders. When people are informed about and involved in  adaptation strategy development, implementation, and monitoring, they are more  likely to call on local leadership to continue support for that. In the best cases, local  agency staff and local organizations are partners during the implementation process", "763": "MPLEMENTATION FUNDING Strategies must be funded regardless of how they are implemented, or the planning  mechanisms used. Funding and financing sources can include local general funds,  bonds, taxes, assessments, fees, grants, private sector partnerships or investments,  non-profit grants and partnerships, among others. The state has many grant programs  to support location adaptation actions funded through cap-and-trade. The  Adaptation Clearinghouses Investing in Adaptation web page lists many funding  opportunities by adaptation sector and has guidance on conducting fiscal analyses of  adaptation strategies.14 It is regularly updated as funding sources evolve. The California  State Library also lists funding opportunities resulting from recent legislation.15 Climate  Adaptation Finance and Investment in California also has guidance on funding  adaptation measures intended for local government staff. The Regional Resilience  Toolkit includes steps for identifying and gathering adaptation funding sources.16 Some  federal sources, such as FEMAs Hazard Mitigation Grant Funding (HMGP) and Building  Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) programs can be used to fund and  finance adaptation actions. Many communities across California have historically used  federal funding for these activities. Non-profit funding sources may also be available. Local agencies often rely on their general fund for partial or full funding of  implementation since they control it and using it does not rely on local ability to  receive grant funding or raise new capital. However, local agencies often have limited  general funds and competing needs for its use. City of Oakland Community-Based Climate Adaptation  Planning The Pacific Institute report conducted in collaboration with OCAC,  Community-Based Climate Adaptation Planning: Case Study of Oakland,  California, identifies methods of engaging frontline communities in the  implementation processfrom the way that climate change is discussed to  the methods that communities use to participate in implementation.13 Two of  these methods are: 1) an appointed task force of stakeholders from throughout  the community who make recommendations about implementation, and 2)  a community-initiated coalition, that is, a coalition of community groups who  make recommendations collaboratively.June 2020 145 California Adaptation Planning Guide In cases where a community does not have general funds, staff, or other funding  resources to implement all adaptation strategies, it can be helpful to rank strategies  by how important it is to enhancing climate resilience and by the local capacity to  fiscally support implementation (refer to Task 1.2). Strategies can be classified based  on whether current support of a strategy would require 1) no budget adjustment, 2)  reallocation of funds, or 3) new and/or external funding.", "764": "OPRs Climate Adaptation Finance and Investment in California includes a chapter on  funding and financing implementation with guidance for local governments regarding  options for bonds and taxes. It also includes grant programs by sector. It is intended to  provide a survey of issues, considerations and sources of funding that can help guide  strategies and tactics for investing in adaptation and resilience in California.20 In times of economic downturn or limited local budget, collaboration with regional  partners can result in joint planning and resource sharing activities, as well as  cooperative purchasing agreements to support implementation. The Alliance  of Regional Collaboratives for Climate Adaptation (ARCCA) provides ways for  communities in many parts of the state to collaborate, limit costs, and achieve  effective adaptation measure development and implementation. AECOM partnered with Resources Legacy Fund to produce Paying for Climate  Adaptation in California: A Primer for Practitioners, a report that synthesizes information  local decision-makers need when thinking about funding and financing climate  adaptation. The report offers a foundational understanding of existing constraints June 2020 147 California Adaptation Planning Guide and opportunities and recommends ways cities, counties, water districts, utilities, state  agencies, private companies, and other entities can make adaptation and resilience  investments.21 The AECOM report categorizes funding opportunities into:  Grants and assessments. Grants, such as planning grants that help fund  acceleration of affordable housing production and streamline housing approvals,  can be obtained for entities at all levels of government, and assessments rely on  property owner. Both of these require high local capacity.  Taxes. Taxes primarily require payment by property owners. Different taxes are  subject to various rules and requirements but may be a good option for certain  adaptation strategies.  Fees. Fees rely on users to generate the funds to support adaptive measure  implementation. In many cases, there are strict rules regarding where such funds  may be spent.  Private involvement. There are a variety of ways in which the private sector can  be involved; however, there is less consistency between examples save for a  common private investment for public benefit. Resources such as Blue Forest Conservations Forest Resilience Bond, the CECs  Characterizing Uncertain Sea Level Rise Projections to Support Investment Decisions,  Finance Guide for Resilient By Design,22 Transit Resiliency Funding Opportunities,23 and others all provide guidance, suggestions, and ideas to guide funding to support  adaptation strategy implementation. Funding is a dynamic component of adaptation  planning. Many of the foundational funding sources are familiar, such as general  funds; others, such as new grant programs or green bond financing, emerge on  an ongoing basis. Many of the websites and resources summarized in this section,  particularly from the State of California, such as the Adaptation Clearinghouse, allow  communities to track the emergence of these resources.", "765": "In cases where an adaptation strategy requires construction of a physical asset  typically included in a capital investment plan, the asset can be included in the  annual or biennial planning process, which are better equipped for financing larger  projects. An effective way to support implementationwhether using the capital  investment plan or local general fundis to demonstrate the fiscal benefits from  loss avoidance and improved public safety. It is almost always less costly to address  climate impacts or hazards ahead of time rather than responding after they happen.", "766": "Step 4.2: Monitor Climate conditions continually change, as do science, community characteristics,  regulations, technology, and other factors that affect adaptation needs. Monitoring  is critical to ensure that the chosen strategies to address community vulnerability  continue to be as effective as planned. For each adaptation strategy, one  department should be designated as the responsible agency for carrying out  monitoring activities, including storing monitoring data. In many cases, this also  requires designation of a dedicated funding source for monitoring activities. The  responsible agency can be a jurisdictional department, regional entity such as a  council of governments, or a community group. If a community group, a specific  memorandum of understanding should be established between a jurisdictional  department or regional entity and the community group to ensure ongoing data  collection and data quality. There should also be a designated department that  gathers and compiles all the monitoring data from all the monitoring entities to  conduct an overall assessment of effectiveness. Monitoring is the easiest and most cost-effective when using an indicator that is  already collected as part of day-to-day operations. During strategy development  and prioritization (Phase 3), the indicator to be monitored should be identified. It  should reflect the impact being addressed, the desired outcome, and the specifics  of the individual strategy. Identified indicators should be collected at a prespecified  intervalat least annually, although more frequent collection rates may be necessary  (such as event frequency or tide height). Example indicators include signals of the  impact being addressed, such as beach width, mean high tide, flood frequency and  peak flow, or fire frequency and intensity; the desired outcomes, such as asthma rates,  days missed from work or school, air quality, or climate hazard losses; and specifics  of the strategy, such as structural condition of mitigation or days and frequency of  closure or service disruption (roads or other assets).", "767": "MONITORING AND OUTREACH The results of monitoring efforts should  be reported regularly to the public to  maintain awareness of effectiveness and  local adaptation needs. Communities  can publish a regular adaptation report  to the public, place the information on  an interactive website that is regularly  updated, or report the results through  other means. The cities of Encinitas,  Burlingame, and Richmond all provide  examples of municipal efforts for  communicating implementation progress.  This type of transparency is critical to  keeping the community engaged in the  ongoing challenge of adaptation. In  particular, this data should be available  and communicated to community  members who are expected to be most  susceptible to climate-related issues.  Some sample actions are:  Document lessons learned during the planning process and ensure that future  planning processes take the lessons into consideration.  Have a community advisory board lead monitoring and review of the plan, or  partner with a university or college program to do this.   Identify mechanisms for holding agencies and departments accountable.   Use open data online platform approaches to sharing climate, project  implementation, and equity information with community members.", "768": "Step 4.3: Evaluate Strategies are evaluated because the increasing severity of climate change  and changes in community characteristics cause continually changing levels of  effectiveness. Monitoring is the first step in adjusting to these changes. The monitoring  data should be analyzed and evaluated to identify if and how a strategy no longer  meets community needs. This evaluation should focus on what the community sees as  the goal of the adaptation strategy, so that effectiveness can be assessed based on  community need. When a strategy is identified as losing effectiveness, a series of steps  are needed to plot a path forward. State legislation may also trigger a re-evaluation  of the vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategies. When a strategy loses effectiveness, the vulnerability and susceptibility of the people,  resources, assets, or operations it affects should be reassessed. It is most practical to  keep the focus of the reassessment as narrow as possiblea new, comprehensive  vulnerability assessment is not always necessary. When updating a vulnerability  assessmentwhether individual scores or the entire analysisthe first priority is  to review any scientific updates and changes to community characteristics. The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change updates its periodic summary of climate  science and global adaptive needs every five to seven years.27 The state issues an  updated Safeguarding California Plan periodically with updated science and state  conditions, and conducts a new Climate Change Assessment every few years.28 There  are also many regional assessments emerging from universities and regional agencies  or nongovernmental entities. All these reports may have updated science and other  useful information.  Another source for new or improved data is datasets or studies prepared in the  aftermath of climate-exacerbated hazards, such as fire or flooding. These resources  often combine local social conditions and context with bio-geophysical factors that  contributed to the experienced hazard event. As community planners know, community characteristics change over time. When an  adaptation strategy loses effectiveness, it is critical to assess whether or not changes  in the community have altered the experienced climate change effects, increased  the vulnerability of any populations or assets, or made any additional community  members or assets susceptible. For example, if a growing community has increased its  level of development and associated impervious surfaces, it may have also increased  its flood risk. The community should assess if the escalating risk disproportionately  affects any specific populations or locations. County health departments are a key  community ally in identifying changes to the population characteristics and to overall  health indicators.", "769": "EVALUATION AND OUTREACH Community outreach and education programs about evaluation can be a very  effective way to engage community members in efforts to shift course in adaptation  strategies. Include the public by, at a minimum, disclosing evaluation outcomes  transparently. This leads to a better understanding of the finite nature of any  single adaptation strategy. It is also possible to include community organizations  or committees in the assessment and evaluation of monitoring data. More direct  participation fosters better understanding across more of the community, and it should  include disproportionately affected or frontline communities in these efforts. Some  sample actions are:  Define and regularly measure a series of equity-related indicators.  Develop a reporting system (e.g., online) to communicate results for the equity- related indicators through time.  Ensure clear avenues for recourse and accountability of project implementation.", "770": "tep 4.4: Adjust Evaluation of monitoring data following measure implementation may reveal the need  for adjustment, which could trigger the strengthening of a strategy or an entirely new  approach to the vulnerability. Each strategy should be evaluated carefully to assess  the extent to which it can be bolstered to address increasing impacts of climate  change and the extent to which it precludes strategies that may more effectively  address the impacts. Such assessments should take place during the first couple  of years of implementation of any strategy so that potential strengthening and  compatibility with other strategies are known from the outset, making for smoother  adjustments based on indicator evaluation. For example, strengthening a sea wall or  flood wall may make retreat or accommodation strategies more difficult to pursue;  however, in many cases, initially bolstering a physical barrier can give a community  time to set up strategies that accommodate higher sea or flood levels. Once those are  in place, the physical barrier should give way to the accommodation strategy (see  Table 13). Evaluation of monitoring data can help communities determine when such  transitions should take place. Strengthening a strategy varies widely by strategy, from changing the speed of  implementation, to altering its location, to revising the implementation mechanism.  The changes to strengthen a strategy should be identified as part of the initial  implementation, and the indicator being monitored should be tied to pre-identified  points where strengthening may be required. 152 Phase 4: Implement, Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust As well as evaluating strategies for the extent to which they can be strengthened, they  should be evaluated for their compatibility with potentially more effective strategies.  In many cases the strategies that are potentially more effective take longer or cost  more to implement, making them better suited to be a longer-term strategy that can  be implemented after priority strategies are put into effect. Choosing when to shift to  the longer-term strategy is more easily managed when specific triggers for the shift are  identified ahead of time (see Table 13). Table 13.

A community should not be surprised by changes in approach,  which should be communicated consistently as a normal part of long-term climate  adaptation strategy implementation. Without appropriate inclusion of the community  throughout the process, changing a strategy could be viewed as abandoning it or as  a failure of implementation rather than as a successful outcome of good monitoring  and evaluation. Sustained engagement with the community and transparency in  monitoring and evaluation can help avoid such misunderstandings, which can lead to  community dissatisfaction with adaptation actions. Additionally, community inclusion  can supplement the selection process for the new or bolstered strategy.June 2020 153 California Adaptation Planning Guide Some sample actions are:  Ensure that lessons learned and outcomes from review and monitoring of  implementation are publicly available.  Use data to inform plan updates and/or make any needed course corrections.  Develop materials allowing for pop-up events to solicit feedback and ideas for  strategy adjustment when needed.  Collaborate with the community to update strategies and program  implementation based on lessons learned from monitoring", "772": "Adaptation (Climate Change): Making changes in response to current or future  conditions (such as the increased frequency and intensity of climate-related hazards),  usually to reduce harm and to take advantage of new opportunities.1, 2 Climate  change adaptation describes actions that address the projected impacts on all  aspects of community function that may result from climate change.

The Adaptation Clearinghouse also provides links to different climate datasets and  case studies and example documents on numerous issues. The Governors Office of  Planning and Research manages the Adaptation Clearinghouse.C-2 Appendix C: Adaptation Planning Resources  California Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (CalBRACE https://www.cdph. ca.gov/Programs/OHE/Pages/CalBRACE.aspx). CalBRACE is a project of the California  Department of Public Healths Climate Change and Health Equity Program, with  an online toolkit to help plan for the public health impacts of climate change. This  program also produces climate change and health vulnerability indicators, which  provide local data on climate change exposures, sensitivities, and adaptive capacities  that can be helpful when assessing human health vulnerabilities. The CalBRACE  framework aligns with the four phases in the Adaptation Planning Guide, with the  addition of an additional step to project the burden of disease. The CalBRACE  framework also focuses on identifying existing health, environmental, and social  conditions as well as projecting how health conditions combine with climate threats to  impact the health and well-being of communities. It provides a framework for public  health adaptation planning, technical information and methods for assessing climate- related health vulnerabilities, and examples of best practices for building health  resiliency. The toolkit also includes case studies that other communities can reference. CalEnviroScreen. CalEnviroScreen 3.0 is an online screening tool that identifies  communities most affected by and vulnerable to the effects of many sources of  pollution and population-based disparities. It aggregates state-wide environmental,  health, and socioeconomic information to produce scores for every census tract  in the state. A census tract with a high score is considered more disadvantaged  than a community with a low score as a result of pollution burden and population  characteristics. When overlaid with climate impact and exposure data,  CalEnviroScreen can provide insight into built and environmental exposure factors  that contribute to vulnerability. 1  The most visible part of CalEnviroScreen is a mapping  and search function, but the tool also allows users to view and download the data  behind the assessment. CalEnviroScreen was developed by the California Office of  Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. California Heat Assessment Tool (CHAT). CHAT is an online tool (https://www.cal-heat. org/) that provides detailed information about future extreme heat conditions  across California. Users can view and download information about extreme heat  for a specific location, including several weather variables, pollution levels, and  demographic and land use factors that influence vulnerability to extreme heat  conditions. The tool also has links to several other resources to help build resiliency to  extreme heat events. The California Natural Resources Agency funded CHAT which  Four Twenty Seven developed in partnership with Argos Analytics, Habitat Seven, and  the Public Health Institute (PHI). California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). OEHHA  assesses the health risks cause by environmental hazards throughout California. The  mission of OEHHA is to protect human health and environmental through scientific June 2020 C-3 California Adaptation Planning Guide evaluation of risks posed by hazardous substances. The indicators of climate change in  California, used to develop CalEnviroScreen 3.0, were developed by OEHHA. California State Hazard Mitigation Plan. The California State Hazard Mitigation Plan  (SHMP) is a summary of the threat posed by hazardous conditions in the state,  strategies to mitigate hazardous events, and information about resources to support  hazard mitigation. Because many of the hazards in the SHMP relate to climate  change, it is a useful resource for better understanding the threat posed by these  hazardous conditions and the states current efforts to mitigate them. The California  Office of Emergency Services leads preparation of the SHMP. MyPlan. MyPlan is an online tool that allows users to enter a location in California,  such as a city or specific address, and view the potential hazards that may affect that  location. The tool includes climate-related hazards, such as floods and wildfires, as  well as non-climate hazards such as seismic activity. It brings together mapping data  from a variety of sources. Users can browse statewide hazard maps and export maps  and mapping data for other purposes. The California Office of Emergency Services  developed MyPlan. Ocean Protection Council Resources. Californias Ocean Protection Councils Climate  Change Program publishes multiple resources meant to assist coastal communities  with adapting to ocean-related climate hazards and building resiliency for oceanic  assets. Resources include State of California Sea-Level Rise Guidance studies and  reports on ocean acidification and its effects, and opportunities for grant funding  on relevant issues. The Ocean Protection Council also works on issues such as marine  pollution and sustainable fisheries, which may relate to climate change resiliency for  some communities.  California Coastal Commission. The California Coastal Commission developed Sea  Level Rise Policy Guidance and Coastal Adaptation Planning Guidance: Residential  Development to provide an overview of the best available science on sea level  rise in California and recommend planning and regulatory actions for adaptation.  These guidance documents are intended to serve as a multi-purpose resource and  includes a high level of detail on many subjects pertaining to sea level rise. The Coastal  Adaptation Planning Guidance: Residential Development guidance provides a range  of land use policies to facilitate planning for resilient coastal communities. Building Blocks: A Comprehensive Housing Element Guide. The Building Blocks Guide is a comprehensive resource explaining requirements, state of practice, and useful  examples under State Housing Element Law. The California Department of Housing  and Community Developments (HCD) Building Blocks Guide was created to assist  jurisdictions in developing housing elements that address varying groups and other  land issues. It also provides resources for local governments to build community C-4 Appendix C: Adaptation Planning Resources  resilience among vulnerable populations, including those experiencing homelessness  and housing insecurity.

From Mountain to Cities, developed by the Alliance of Regional  Collaboratives for Climate Adaptation, describes the interconnections between  upstream rural communities, and downstream urban areas. This whitepaper focuses  on the resources that the Sierra Nevada Mountains provide communities throughout  the state and presents the need for urgent and ongoing collaboration to address  current and future climate related hazards. California Ready Program. The Climate Ready Program, administered by the California  Coastal Conservancy, provides grant funding to multi--benefit projects that use  natural systems to assist communities in adapting to the effects of climate change.  This program has awarded $10.7 million for 57 projects throughout the state that  provide both adaptation and greenhouse gas reductions. Eligible grantees include  government agencies, non-profit organizations, and federally recognized tribes with  projects that use nature-based solutions, promote collaboration, reduce greenhouse  gas emissions, address the needs of underserved coastal populations, promote  on-the-ground demonstration projects, and incorporate outreach and education.June 2020 C-5 California Adaptation Planning Guide Federal Resources  FEMAs Local Mitigation Planning Handbook is a guidance document to help  communities across the country develop hazard mitigation plans. Although hazard  mitigation plans are not necessarily identical to adaptation planning efforts, there is  significant overlap between the two. The guidance and resources in this handbook  can also be used for adaptation planning. The handbook includes information  about assembling stakeholders and conducting outreach, determining community  capabilities, assessing the potential for harm, and developing hazard mitigation  strategies. It also contains checklists and worksheets for use throughout the hazard  mitigation process. The Local Mitigation Planning Handbook was last updated in 2013. US Census Bureaus data.census.gov. Data.census.gov is an online database hosted  by the US Census Bureau that allows users to view, download, and map results from  the decennial census, the annual American Community Survey, and other specialized  surveys and analyses carried out by the Census Bureau. This updated database also  includes a mapping feature that allows planners to visually display the results of the  data. Adaptation planners can use data.census.gov to understand the demographic  and other socioeconomic characteristics of a community, such as how many residents  belong to a particular frontline community. US Climate Resilience Toolkit. The US Climate Resilience Toolkit is a set of national  resources to assist practitioners in conducting climate adaptation work. It provides a  number of tools for looking up climate changerelated data, guidance documents on  the climate adaptation process, and case studies on improving resiliency.

This guide provides background  on inequities in planning, as well as a framework conducting an inclusive climate  preparedness process. Table 8 of this guide demonstrates considerations and  strategies that can be integrated into climate adaptation measures to account for  social and climate justice inequities in communities. Making Equity Real in Climate Adaptation and Community Resilience Policies  and Programs: A Guidebook The Greenlining Institute aims to advance economic  opportunity and empowerment for people of color through advocacy, community  building, and leadership development. This guidebook prioritizes the climate  adaptation and community resilience needs of frontline communities and offers  planning staff a step-by-step process for defining equity in measurable factors in  policies and grant programs. These steps include embedding equity in the mission,  vision, and values; building equity in the process; ensuring equitable outcomes; and  measuring and analyzing for equity.June 2020 C-7 California Adaptation Planning Guide Healthy Places Index. The Healthy Places Index, developed by the Public Health  Alliance of Southern California, is an interactive mapping tool that combines 25  community characteristics into a weighted score that ranks census tracts across  California for conditions that support health. It displays some climate change  exposures, sensitivities, and adaptive capacities in decision support layers to assist in  assessing climate and health vulnerability and planning for policy changes to support  community resilience. Mapping Resilience: A Blueprint for Thriving in the Face of Climate Disasters Mapping Resilience, prepared by the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, aims  to raise the public visibility of the needs of frontline communities within statewide  climate adaptation and resilience efforts. For adaptation planning, the report  provides research and resources on communities disproportionately impacted by  climate changerelated disasters in California and lessons learned from examples  across the US; key existing indicators, data, tools, and analytical frameworks for  understanding the intersection of climate impacts, health and well-being outcomes,  socioeconomic vulnerability, and adaptive capacity factors; and lessons learned from  development and use of indicators in related fields (e.g., public health, environmental  justice, and land use).  Community-Driven Climate Resilience Planning Framework. Community-Driven  Climate Resilience Planning Framework was developed by the Movement Strategy  Center and community-based organizations across the country to strengthen climate  adaptation efforts through culturally relevant, democratic processes with meaningful  community engagement. The primary audience of this resource is community-based  organizations developing, advocating for, and implementing climate solutions;  however, local government staff can use this resource to help increase cross-sector  collaboration and increase the communitys voice and leadership role in the  adaptation process. Coastal Adaptation Policy Briefs. The Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions developed  a set of Coastal Adaptation Policy Briefs that provide engineering, financial, and legal  and regulatory solutions for coastal resources. Each policy brief introduces coastal  adaptation strategy, describes trade-offs and any legal considerations, and illustrates  examples of projects along the California coast. The financial resources include  buyout programs, conservation easements, geologic hazard abatement districts, and  transfer of development rights solutions.C-8 Appendix C: Adaptation Planning Resources  Tribal Climate Change Adaptation Planning Template. This toolkit, developed by the  Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals, contains templates and other resources  to support tribal climate change efforts.

The toolkit also contains a list of tribal climate change  assessments and adaptation plans from several different states.", "778": "This guidebook is intended to assist managers  and planners in Californias coastal cities and  counties in developing sea level rise adaptation  plans for their communities. State agency staff who work with these issues may also find it useful. It begins with an introduction that provides back- ground information about climate change and sea  level rise and an explanation of why planners in  coastal communities should begin to plan for sea  level rise and the associated coastal hazards.", "779": "The procedures and approaches that are outlined  in the Guide are informed by work with two of  Californias coastal communities, Santa Cruz and  Santa Barbara. For Santa Cruz, a general Climate  Change Vulnerability Study was completed and a  Climate Change Adaptation Plan has been written.  A Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment was  prepared for the city of Santa Barbara during the  process of Guide development, so that this Guide  could be informed by an actual case study. The ap- proaches to adaptation that are described in the  following pages serve as examples of processes  that may not suit all communities. Local govern- ments should feel free to adjust the suggested  approaches and methods accordingly. We are en- tering uncharted territory here, and communities  can learn from each other about what works and  what does not, and coordinate their efforts and re- sponses on a regional basis. Also, pulling together a Sea Level Rise Prepared- ness Team (explained in Chapter 2), conducting  a vulnerability study, preparing a hazard and risk  assessment, selecting appropriate adaptation  measures, obtaining funding and implementing  adaptation plans may be more complicated than  they appear to be here, especially for very large  communities.", "780": "Worldwide, over 200 million people globally are  vulnerable to short-term elevated sea level events  or flooding (Nichols, 2010).

California also has the nations largest ocean economy, valued at  about $47 billion/year, with the great majority of  this connected to coastal recreation and tourism  as well as shipping and ports. Many of the facili- ties and much of the infrastructure that support  these industries, as well as the states many miles  of public beaches, are within just a few feet of  present sea leve", "781": "For the locations where the land is rising, the rate  of sea level rise may be outpaced by the rate of  coastal uplift. At Crescent City, for example, along  the northern California coast, the local NOAA tide  gauge records show a drop in sea level of two  inches, or 0.65 mm/yr since 1933 when the gauge  was first installed (Figure 2.3). The northern Cali- fornia and southern Oregon coasts are both being  uplifted due to tectonic activity, which proceeds  in those locations today at a rate greater than the  rate of global sea level rise. However, the far north  coast is the only place along Californias shoreline  where sea level is currently dropping relative to  the land surface.", "782": "Beginning in 1992, several satellites have been  launched with the capability of measuring the  level of the ocean from space very accurately. The  18 years of data that have been collected to date  are free of the effects of vertical land movements that can affect tide gauge measurements. They indicate that the global rate of sea level rise has  increased to a little over three millimeters per year  between 1993 and 2010 (Figure 2.4).  Recent research and climate change analysis in- dicate that the rate of sea level rise will likely ac- celerate during the coming decades as ocean wa- ter continues to warm and expand and as the ice  sheets and glaciers of Greenland and West Antarc- tica break up more rapidly than were previously  anticipated. ", "783": "Sea level rise has been taking place since the end  of the last Ice Age, about 20,000 years ago. Al- though global sea level rise has been fairly grad- ual, coastal California has noticeably experienced  its effects for at least the past century. According to the 2009 California Climate Adaptation Strat- egy, sea level has risen by an average of about 7  inches along Californias 1100-mile coastline during  this period, contributing to progressive shoreline  retreat and coastal cliff, bluff and dune erosion.", "784": "By the year 2100, mean sea level may rise by as  much as 40 to 55 inches (1 to 1.4 meters) along  the coast of California, although these projections  are being modified as observations continue to be made and additional data become available. The  California Ocean Protection Council, working with  the Coast and Ocean Climate Action Team (CO- CAT), which consists of representatives from 15  different state agencies, have adopted interim sea level rise projections for the decades ahead using  the high scenarios in all cases for 2030, 2050, 2070  and 2100 (Table 2.1).  Rates of sea level rise are region-specific because long-term land motion influences sea level at any individual location. In California, sea level has been  measured historically at 14 different tide gauge stations between San Diego and Crescent City, al- though two of these stations were discontinued  during the 1990s (Table 2.2). Eight of the stations  have at least 50 years of data, and the oldest sta- tion at San Francisco has been in operation since  1857 (Table 2.2)", "785": "Local sea level rise rates at 10 of the 12 stations  covering the 800 miles from San Diego to Point  Reyes vary surprising little, from 3.1 to 8.3 inches  per century (or 0.75 to 2.10 millimeters per year).  There are significant year-to-year variations. A close look at the San Francisco tide gauge at Fort  Point, near the Golden Gate Bridge, for example,  reveals the clear signature of large El Nio events  that have affected the coastline at various points in the past century (Figure 2.5). Sea levels along  the entire California coast have been elevated for  months at a time during these events. During the large El Nio event of 1983, high water  level at the Golden Gate Bridge reached 8.87 ft, or  1.77 ft higher than predicted, the highest in over a  century of record keeping. Sea levels in Los Ange- les that year were also the highest in sixty years of  tide gauge history, (7.96 ft, or 1.06 ft above pre- dicted), as they were in San Diego (8.35 ft, which is  0.95 ft above predicted, the highest in the 77-year  history of that station). In addition to these ex- treme tides, the 1997-98 El Nio also was accom- panied by sustained periods of elevated sea levels.  The following chapters will discuss the importance  of these short-term events to coastal flooding and Table 2.2. Historic Sea-Level Rise Rates from Tide Gauges along the California Coast.

At  Humboldt Bays North Spit, sea level is rising by  18.6 inches per century (4.73 millimeters per year),  the highest rate in California (Figure 2.6). Just 80  miles north at Crescent City, sea level is dropping  relative to the coastline by 2.5 inches per century  (0.65 millimeters per year) (Figure 2.6). The shore- line at Humboldt Bay is subsiding, whereas Cres- cent Citys coastline is rising.", "787": "A vulnerability assessment is the first step in the process of developing an informed sea level rise  adaptation plan (Figure 3.1). Assessing a commu- nitys vulnerability to sea level rise needs to con- sider three factors: 1] the probable magnitude of  sea level rise and its associated impacts; 2] the  sensitivity or exposure of the planning area to  sea level rise and future storm and wave impacts; Page 11 and 3] the ability of the community to adapt or re- spond to the anticipated impacts. A vulnerability assessment should include an  evaluation of the degree of a communitys expo- sure to various shoreline hazards as well as the  magnitude of the impact in the case of a signifi- cant event, such as a large El Nio storm or storm  surge that elevates sea level significantly. In turn, adaptation is the adjustment of natural or human  systems to actual or expected phenomena or their  effects, such that it minimizes damage or harm. A coastal communitys adaptive capacity is defined by its ability to respond to sea level rise and oth- er coastal hazards. This includes the reduction or  moderation of potential damages and coping with  their expected or predicted consequences", "788": "One approach for conducting a coastal haz- ards vulnerability assessment is to form a  Sea Level Rise/Coastal Hazard Preparedness Team  (abbreviated the Team), which can be a formal or  informal group. The quality, value and acceptance  of any adaptation plan ultimately depends upon  the involvement and buy-in of the directors of the  public agencies that stand to be affected by sea level rise and associated impacts. Political lead- ers and/or elected officials will also need to be on board prior to plan completion and adoption.", "789": "Team makeup may vary according to a commu- nitys size, resources and vulnerability to sea level  rise. The Team could involve or include local gov- ernment staff from economic development, emer- gency response agencies, parks and recreation,  planning and zoning, transportation, public works  including flood control, wastewater treatment, water supply, and port and harbor management,  or some combination of these that is appropriate  for the individual city or county. Other potential  team members may include consultants, scientific advisors, or members of the business community.  Depending on the formality of the group, the com- position of the Team might change as it moves  through the vulnerability assessment process. It is  possible that sea level rise will affect more sectors of a community than the Team initially realizes,  so members may be added. On the other hand,  some members may not be needed if the assess- ment reveals less vulnerability in certain sectors  than anticipated.", "790": "Many city and county staff have full sched- ules, especially with budget and staff cuts associated with the states economic downturn,  often making it difficult for them to find time to dedicate to additional planning efforts and com- mittee meetings (Moser 2007). A more efficient and effective approach for sea level rise planning is to utilize a consultant or consulting firm work- ing with a small group of key city or county agency  staff. A carefully selected consultant or consulting firm should have expertise and experience in the rel- evant issues (climate change and sea level rise,  coastal processes and hazards, for example), a  strong track record of working successfully with  coastal communities, and the time necessary for  completing the entire planning process within a  finite period. In this case, the Team may consist of the consultant and several key local govern- ment department staff, using other staff members as resources for providing input and information  about specific issues, reviewing draft documents and assisting with the editing and preparation of  a final plan. Local ownership of the final adapta- tion plan is important and a good reason for on- going involvement of the local government staff. It is easier to put a consultants report on a shelf  and forget about it, in contrast to ignoring what a  group of city or county staff people worked hard on, come to believe in, and are passionate about.

There are two components  of sea level that are important to any individual city  or county: 1] the extreme sea levels or tidal eleva- tions that have been recorded in the past, and will  likely occur in the future, 2] the long-term rate at  which relative sea level is rising in your region.  The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Ad- ministration (NOAA) provides current information  about regional sea level, both extreme historic lev- els and also trends in sea level rise that come from  its tide gauges. These combine data about ocean  level fluctuations and vertical land motion at a number of locations along Californias coastline. An  important consideration in the use of these data is  the time period covered by the closest gauge(s) to  a particular community. The time period should be  long enough (ideally 30-40 years or more) to distin- guish short-term and decadal variations from long- term trends.

Collect all Information on Communitys Historical Vulnerability to Coastal Hazards ful. Some of the most convincing evidence of the  threats posed by future sea level rise and coastal  storms are written accounts, maps of affected or damaged areas, or photographs of past events.  Such records make it clear that these events have  occurred in the past and will occur again, although  most likely with greater frequency and intensity.  Appendix B includes a listing of all of the major El  Nio events to impact the California coast from  1912 - 1994 (Storlazzi & Griggs, 2000). This is a  good starting point for checking on historical re- cords or specific dates in newspaper archives to see what local impacts or damages may have re- sulted from these events. Task B. Obtain Sea Level Information While sporting goods store or surf shop tide tables  provide reasonable estimates of the expected el- evations of the high and low tides each day, up to  a year in advance, a number of oceanographic or  meteorological processes can raise regional sea  level significantly above the predicted tidal eleva- tions. El Nios, low atmospheric pressure, strong  storms and large waves can all raise sea level above  predicted elevations for hours to weeks (Figures  2.5 and 3.2). A subsequent section on Temporary  Increases in Sea Level During El Nio Events or  Storms will explain this in more detail.  Over at least the next 30 to 40 years, it is these  short-term events that will likely present the great- est flooding and inundation hazards to coastal communities, rather than the more gradual long- term rise in sea level. The NOAA website for each  tide gauge or water level recorder will contain  information on the extremes recorded each year  and how much they exceeded the predicted high  tides at those sites.  The historic record of sea level change for each  station can serve as useful minimum baselines  or starting points for projecting future sea level", "799": "changes. Unfortunately, not every coastal commu- nity has its own tide gauge, and some historic re- cords are relatively short. Southern California has  the most coverage and it once had five NOAA tide gauges between San Diego and Santa Monica, or  one about every 30 miles on average (Table 2.2).

There  are three additional permanent tide gauges along  the 422 miles of coastline between the Golden  Gate Bridge and the Oregon border, or on aver- age, one station for every 140 miles of coastline.  Much of this area, however, is sparsely populated;  development, with the exception of Crescent City  and the Humboldt Bay area, is usually well above  sea level on uplifted marine terraces.", "800": "Although predicting the future always involves  uncertainty, a community will nevertheless  need to consider the potential for future accel- erated rise in global sea level to affect local sea level trends. Many climate scientists and research  groups around the world have been working on  improving methods and models for estimating  future global sea level rise based on a range of  greenhouse gas emission scenarios and therefore,  future atmospheric and ocean temperatures.  The continued warming of the atmosphere and  oceans, as well as the continued retreat of moun- tain glaciers and melting of ice caps and shelves  of Greenland and Antarctica, are all parts of the  equation. Depending upon their responses to con- tinued warming, they will affect sea level globally. The California Ocean Protection Council and State  agencies have adopted future sea level projec- tions (Table 2.1). The various projections or models  for future sea level rise produce similar results for  2030 (5 to 8 inches of global sea level rise), with  increasing differences by 2050 (10-17 inches) and considerable divergence by 2100, (ranging from 31  to 69 inches, or 2.5 to nearly 6 feet) (Figure 3.3)  This increasing divergence of values as we go fur- ther into the future is common with any extrapo- lation or projection, simply because of the uncer- tainties in both natural processes as well as human  behavior and government decisions. exposure to sea level rise), is whether it may be  advisable to work with NOAA to have a tide gauge  installed in the community in order to begin to  monitor sea level and how it is changing over time.  Komar et al. (2011) recently completed an as- sessment of sea level variations along the Pacific Northwest coast from Humboldt Bay in northern  California to Neah Bay on the Olympic Peninsula  in Washington. They relate differences in sea lev- el records to changing climate and differences in land motion, whether uplift or subsidence. For the  northern California coast, this work provides some  regional perspective about how the elevation of  the coastline has changed over time and, there- fore, how local sea level rise has been affected. Determining Most Appropriate Tidal Gauge Data For the many coastal communities that do not  have local tide gauges, it will be necessary to  determine which is the closest and most appro- priate station to use. Overall, the differences in the rates of sea level rise along Californias entire  coastline for the past 50 to 100 years are quite  small, however. The range of rates that have been  recorded at 10 of the 12 stations, covering the  800 miles from San Diego to Point Reyes, range  from 3.1 to 8.3 inches/century (0.75 to 2.10 mm/ yr) (Table 3.1 and Figure 2.6). Therefore, for most  communities, using rates of sea level rise from the  closest station or stations, at least for the next 25  to 50 years, does not present major concerns. One  additional consideration (depending upon a com- munitys distance from a NOAA tide gauge and its  Chapter3 Conducting a Sea Level Rise and Coastal Hazards Vulnerability Assessment The National Research Councils study is evaluat- ing all of the factors that are expected to affect future sea level rise along the States coastline and  is developing up-to-date projections based on the  best available information and science.

Most of the ma- jor historic storm damage to Californias coastline  has occurred during El Nio storms, which were  especially devastating during 1982-83 and 1997-98  (Figures 3.4 and 3.5).  Sea levels along the states coastline often rise sub- stantially, ~12 inches or more (albeit temporarily),  during El Nios, when the Eastern Pacific Ocean is warmer than usual and westerly wind patterns  are strengthened. The 1982-83 and 1997-98 El Nio  events caused hundreds of millions of dollars in  storm damage to private and public property as  well as infrastructure, due to the combination of  temporarily elevated sea levels and large storm  waves, which in 1983 repeatedly coincided with  high tides (Figure 3.6 and Figure 3.7; Griggs and  Brown, 1998; Griggs, et al. 2005). In late January 1983, sea levels were the highest  that had ever been recorded in San Diego, Los An- geles and San Francisco, at 9.6, 12.2 and 18.7 inches  above the predicted high tide levels, respectively.

When evaluating the possible consequences of  global sea level rise for their community, a Team  could handle the future uncertainty by perform- ing a sea level rise hazards assessment by using a  few different projected future sea level rise sce- narios and different time frames.

Long-term wave data from buoys located  off of the coasts of California, Oregon and Wash- ington provide evidence of increasing offshore wave heights (Ruggiero, et al, 2010). While it is not  yet certain whether these increased wave heights  are related to warming of the oceans, there is a  high probability that these phenomena are relat- ed. The causes for increased wave heights are not  agreed upon yet, but they might include changes  in storm tracks, higher wind speeds, increasingly  intense winter storms, or other factors. During the 22-year period from 1980 to 2002, the  average wave height increased by 1.5 feet along  Figure 3.8. Inundation of East Cliff Drive at Twin Lakes State Beach in Santa Cruz during elevated sea levels, high tides and storm waves in February 1998 (Photo: David Revell). the central California coast (Storlazzi and Wing- field, 2005). It is also important to keep in mind that these wave heights are based on the 22-year  record between 1980 and 2002 but the trend is for  increasing heights, so these values may continue  to increase over time. Seymour (2011) summarized evidence for changes  in the Northeast Pacific wave climate by analyzing the number of occurrences of waves with average  heights that were greater than 20 feet (6 meters).  He divided the data into two 12-year periods (1984- 1995 and 1996-2007) and found that for the area  from Pt. Conception to the Oregon border, there  is a substantial increase in the number of occur- rences of these large waves between the first and the second time periods (Figure 3.9).", "807": "Most communities along the California coast  were negatively affected by three El Nio winters: 1978, 1983 and 1997-98. There are state- wide inventories of both impacts and damage  (California Coastal Commission, 1978; Domurat,  1978; Swisher, 1983; Griggs and Johnson, 1983;  Seymour, 1998; Storlazzi and Griggs, 1998). Local  accounts typically are reported in local newspa- pers or are in the files of public works, planning", "808": "Changes in the wave climate along southern Cali- fornia (from Pt. Conception to the Mexican bor- der) are less pronounced than they are along the  central and northern California coastline. In the  1984 to 1995 period, there were 7 storm events  with waves 16 feet or higher and 4 events that re- sulted in wave heights of 20 feet or higher. Dur- ing the 1996 to 2010 period, however, there were  69 events that resulted in wave heights of 16 feet  or greater and 10 events that resulted in wave  heights of 20 feet or greater (Figure 3.10). Coastal storms are expected to continue to in- crease in frequency and intensity during the com- ing decades (Barnard, et al, 2011). When increas- ingly large waves are combined with a gradually  rising sea level, we can expect an increase in the  frequency of the flooding of low-lying areas (Fig- ure 3.11) and an increased risk and rate of coastal  cliff retreat. Although wave characteristics may change in unknown ways in the future, their pat- terns over the past several decades have been  well documented.  The effects of storm waves upon the coast are not new to California, which has been battered fre- quently during the recent past (Figures. 3.12 and  3.13). Rather, these effects are likely to be exacer- bated by rising sea levels.", "809": "The next step in assessing a communitys vul- nerability to sea level rise is to map areas of  potential future coastal flooding and inundation. The impact of future sea level rise is dependent  upon the level of the ocean at various times in the  future, the topography or elevation of shoreline  areas, and the degree of development or amount  of infrastructure.  ", "810": "By establishing a baseline that shows how storm- related hazards have affected a communitys shoreline planning areas in the past, a Team can  begin to envision how increasingly severe or fre- quent hazards might affect the same areas in the future. It will therefore be better positioned to  monitor and respond to those changes as they oc- cur. Individual or community disaster memories of- ten are short, and photographs or maps of historic  damage or coastal flooding will serve as important reminders of past events for todays planning. A useful initial step for any coastal community  would be for the Team to compile its own his- tory of coastal storm damage over the past 50 or  100 years in order to illustrate to elected officials, agency staff and others that the events to be ex- pected during the future are not necessarily new,  but they will most likely occur with greater fre- quency and intensity than in the past.  There are general databases of past storm his- tory along the California coast that are helpful for  such a compilation (see Griggs and Johnson, 1983;  Griggs and Fulton-Bennett, 1987). Storlazzi and  Griggs (2000) compiled a history of El Nio events  that occurred during the last century. It provides  a good starting point for a search of local records  (newspaper archives, for example) to find evi- dence and documentation of historic storm dam- age. Appendix B lists the major El Nio events by  their relative intensity or severity. ", "811": "The interaction of the physical processes that  produce cliff erosion or retreat, (i.e. wave impact, rainfall and runoff, earthquakes, etc.), with the dif- ferent types of rocks that are exposed along the  coast, has resulted in wide-ranging erosion rates  along Californias 1,100-mile coastline. At some  sites, such as the Monterey peninsula, cliff erosion has been negligible for the 75100 years because  the granite is very hard and resistant to wave at- tack. Ten miles north along the sandy bluffs of southern Monterey Bay, the average rate of re- treat ranges from two to seven feet per year. In  general, weak sedimentary rocks such as the sand- stone, siltstone, mudstone and shale that form  much of Californias coastline, retreat at long-term  average rates of a few inches to a foot or more per  year. Coastal erosion tends to be episodic, however,  with much of the long-term cliff and bluff failure taking place during a few severe storm events ev- ery 5 or 10 years. The arrival of large storm waves at  times of high tides and elevated sea levels, which  frequently occur during major El Nio events, can  produce severe coastal erosion in areas that were  formerly thought to be relatively stable.  Although the average long-term rate of retreat of  the cliffs in Capitola has been about one foot per year, large slabs may collapse overnight, moving  the cliff edge back by 5 to 10 feet, followed by little change for a number of years (Figure 3.22). Short- term cliff erosion rates are often very different from long-term (3050 year) averages and need  to be viewed with caution (Lester, 2005).", "812": "A recommended starting point in assessing future  coastal erosion hazards in a community is to com- pile all of the existing erosion information for your  city or county coastline. There are several sources  for these data, including both site-specific studies as well as regional or statewide compilations.  Most development or re-development proposals  for cliff or bluff-top parcels in California are re- quired to undertake geological and/or geotechni- cal investigations that evaluate cliff stability and retreat rates. These reports should all be on file in Planning Departments by parcel number and they  could be assembled in a GIS base.  The California Coastal Commission recently com- pleted a statewide project that compiled all of the  coastal erosion data in their files from consultant reports into a single database. That information  is publicly available on a CD and it provides a valu- able resource of existing erosion rate data (Dare,  2005).  Living with the Changing California Coast (Griggs,  et al. 2005), includes mile-by-mile hazard maps for  the entire coast of California, including erosion  rates where available. Geologists familiar with  specific areas wrote individual regional chapters and identified and described specific hazardous areas.  Depending upon the extent of coverage of the  existing erosion rate data for a particular city or  county and the extent of undeveloped ocean- front land remaining, there may be a need for and  value in performing a cliff erosion study in order to fill in any gaps. Most coastal cities and counties are already well  aware of the areas within their jurisdictions that  are subject to cliff or bluff erosion problems. The municipalities probably already have building set- back procedures or guidelines in place, as well  as requirements for geological or geotechnical  investigations prior to issuing building permits.  A study of coastal hazard policies for the states  coastal cities and counties completed 20 years ", "813": "ago, however, determined that there was consid- erable variation in how local governments dealt  with issues such as setbacks for cliff and bluff con- struction (Griggs, et al, 1992). Each city and county should begin by re-evaluating  their existing cliff and bluff setback requirements, and the historic erosion rate data to determine  which parcels and structures are located within  setback zones or areas likely to be affected by cliff retreat at specific future times (e.g. 2030, 2050, 2100).  ", "814": "The final step in assessing risk involves evaluat- ing a coastal communitys adaptive capacity,  because its vulnerability to sea level rise depends  not only upon physical stressors to the local shore- line but also on the ability of affected areas to adapt to those changes (NOAA, 2010). The Team  Chapter4 Risk AssessmentPage 30 Adapting to Sea Level Rise: A Guide for Californias Coastal Communities must determine which adaptation options are  available while considering the likelihood that the  highest projected sea level rise may prevail. (See  the following chapter for information about ad- aptation strategies.) The types of effects to be ex- pected as a result of sea level rise, the potential  costs of adaptation, and the longevity of various  adaptation options need to be considered as well.  Adaptive capacity may be described in terms of  a communitys ability to prepare for, respond to,  and recover from sea level rise impacts. A Team  should evaluate the following: 1. regulatory and planning capabilities (e.g., de- velopment restrictions, coastal management  regulations, hazard mitigation, sustainability,  shoreline management, post-disaster recov- ery/emergency plans, etc.); 2. administrative and technical capabilities (e.g.,  the number of sea level rise experts, planners,  engineers, GIS and mapping resources and  modeling capabilities, etc.); 3. fiscal capacity (e.g., taxes, bonds, grants, im- pact fees, withholding spending in hazard  zones and insurance); and 4. infrastructure (e.g., flood and erosion control structures, evacuation routes and redundant  water, wastewater and power systems) . As with the determination of a coastlines vulner- ability to sea level rise, it is helpful to use scenario  planning when determining a coastal communitys  adaptive capacity. A Team should develop a range  of plausible sea level rise outcomes (probabilities  and consequences) based on multiple points in  time (e.g. 2030, 2050 and 2100) and multiple sea  level projections in order to provide a basis for  further adaptation planning. It is recommended  to use the projections for future sea level rise that  are currently employed by Californias state agen- cies: 5-8 inches by 2030, 10-17 inches of sea level  rise by the year 2050 and 40-55 inches by 2100, or  the values that will be developed by the Nation- al Research Councils Sea Level Rise Committee.  Each completed scenario should include quanti- tative projections of future sea level rise and de- scriptions of the potential associated impacts and  consequences.", "815": "Adaptive capacity may be described in terms of  a communitys ability to prepare for, respond to,  and recover from sea level rise impacts.", "816": "After priorities (such as reducing risks to critical  infrastructure from future sea level rise) are  clearly identified, a Team can define its adaptation goals. Goals should establish desired endpoints by  stating the preferred long-term outcomes of ad- aptation to sea level rise. Some examples of goals  include the following (NRC, 2010): 1. a plan or time line for phased relocation of ex- isting infrastructure or public facilities away  from vulnerable areas, 2. site and design all future public works projects  to take into account projections for sea level  rise, 3. eliminate public subsidies for future develop- ment in high hazard coastal areas, 4. prioritize critical public infrastructure for ret- rofitting/protection (storm water/wastewa- ter systems, energy facilities, roads, bridges,  ports), 5. potential removal of barriers to landward mi- gration of heavily used public beaches and es- tuaries/wetlands, 6. develop strategic property acquisition pro- grams to discourage development in hazard- prone areas; encourage relocation; and allow  inland migration of coastal habitats, 7. discourage placement of shoreline armoring  and encourage alternatives, and 8. encourage sustainable forms of development  (such as clustered or higher density develop- ment in low-risk areas).", "817": "PLAN OBJECTIVES AND ACTION MEASURES I t is important to note that the most successful  long-term coastal management programs set  unambiguous, quantifiable, time-bounded objec- tives, (in contrast to vague or open-ended goals).  Specific geographic areas that are of the highest risk, (either due to their low elevations or proximi- ties to retreating cliffs), should be mapped and de- lineated, and timelines should be established for  actions that are based on agreed-upon conditions  or thresholds. For example, by the time high tides  reach a certain elevation, a relocation plan has  been established and action is initiated. Further- more, when a retreating cliff or bluff edge erodes to within a certain distance of a street, sidewalk,  sewer or water line, a clear retreat plan has been  approved. The team should remember to focus primar- ily upon planned or proactive adaptation, as op- posed to reactive adaptation. Reactive adapta- tion includes changes in policy and behaviors that  people and organizations adopt after changes in  coastal risks are observed or communities have  already sustained damage. For example, as prop- erty losses from increasing wave heights and in- creasingly severe coastal storms and sea level  rise increase in frequency, insurance companies  will likely raise their rates or drop coverage alto- gether, resulting in a disincentive to live in hazard  zones. This has already begun to happen along the  hurricane-prone barrier islands that line the South  Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The  purpose of adapting to sea level rise, though, is to  avoid such problems altogether by planning ahead  for the future. In this way, planned adaptation is  intentional, rational, and it aims to address the full  range of sea level rise hazards such that it meets  societal objectives", "818": "A range of criteria may be used for selecting the  best adaptation options for a particular coastal  community. These include actual effectiveness, cost and benefit, ease of design and implementa- tion, and public and political acceptability. Each  potential adaptation measure should be reviewed  individually using those criteria or guidelines. The  Team should recommend to decision-makers the  choices that are most likely to be successfully im- plemented. These may be the most cost-effective, easiest to implement, or most politically accept- able choices.", "819": "There are three different types of future plan- ning or adaptation considerations for coastal  properties in most cities or counties:  1. Undeveloped parcels that are considered or  are zoned to be developable.  2. Existing unprotected development, including  residential and commercial areas as well as in- frastructure (i.e. streets, parking lots, parks,  bike paths, sewer or water lines, etc.). 3. Existing development that has already been  armored. A Team should be aware of the different adapta- tion strategies that are available for both existing  and planned future development. Some communi- ties have highly developed coastlines, while oth- ers that have some undeveloped land could take  advantage of the opportunity to address potential  future issues proactively. Undeveloped land pres- ents the easiest opportunity for planning ahead  or adapting to future sea level rise when taking  into account the very high probability of increased  rates of coastal erosion.  Combining historical cliff or bluff erosion rates with the projected lifespan of any future develop- ADAPTATION STRATEGIES: UNDEVELOPED VS. DEVELOPED LAND ment has been the most common method of de- termining a safe setback distance from an eroding  cliff or bluff edge. However, an increased erosion rate or safety factor needs to be considered, al- though there is not yet an agreed upon statewide  method or value for this. A conservative approach  is strongly recommended. Considering the State- adopted rate of future sea level rise and high prob- ability of inundation or increased cliff or bluff ero- sion, it is the responsibility of an applicant and/or  their consultant to make a case for the safety of a  proposed structure during its lifetime.", "820": "Possible strategies for new, planned development  include mandatory setbacks to restrict develop- ment in vulnerable areas, required warning notic- es to developers and buyers regarding the poten- tial impacts of future sea level rise or cliff retreat, smart growth and clustered development in low- risk areas, and the development of expendable or  mobile structures in vulnerable areas. The word  resiliency is often used to describe a possible  approach to development or land uses in hazard- ous zones. While public lands such as undeveloped  parks, parking lots, bicycle or jogging trails could  be considered resilient, because they can recover  after being flooded or covered with debris follow- ing large storms, it appears that very little private", "821": "coastal development can be considered resilient  or capable of withstanding rising sea level, inunda- tion or wave impact without serious damage.", "822": "An additional issue to consider is the difference between public and private property.

This may be an uphill battle,  but in the long run, the costs of restricting or limit- ing new development in recognized hazard areas  (such as eroding sea cliffs or low-lying areas sub- Chapter5 Developing an Adaptation PlanPage 36 Adapting to Sea Level Rise: A Guide for Californias Coastal Communities ject to flooding or inundation) would be far lower than the costs of dealing with damaged or immi- nently threatened development. For existing private development in vulnerable  areas, strategies for addressing sea level rise im- pacts include: 1. Planned retreat or relocation incentives from  high-risk areas. Establish mandatory rolling  setbacks for any future development or sig- nificant redevelopment in areas that are likely to be affected by sea level rise or cliff retreat within the anticipated lifetime of the structure. 2. Develop a plan and policies and identify fund- ing or tax incentives for purchasing or relocat- ing existing structures out of areas that are  subject to future sea level rise or cliff erosion. 3. Restrict the rebuilding of vulnerable structures  that have been damaged by storms and/or  damage due to sea level rise. 4. Evaluate presently armored areas to deter- mine whether additional armor or retreat is  the most practical long-term approach. 5. Reduce and eliminate dependence on armor- ing (although there may be some critical struc- tures where armoring may provide short to  intermediate-term protection until other solu- tions can be implemented).  For existing public infrastructure or community  resources, whether they be roads, parks, parking  areas, sewer lines or sewage pumping stations: 1. seawalls may provide short-term protection,  depending upon their specific locations and el- evations, but 2. removal and relocation or replacement strate- gies should be regarded as the most effective long-term solutions. Develop retreat orretrofit plans for existing infrastructure that is subject  to future inundation. 3. Design and site all future city or county proj- ects and infrastructure to account for sea level  rise predictions based upon the projected life- spans of the projects. The critical question for each facility or structure  is: Based on the consideration of all of the costs  and benefits as well as the risks, at what point should a community take action? A shoreline  park or parking lot can be used intermittently for  a long time with periodic winter inundation, but a  sewer line or pumping station at beach elevation  must be relocated or replaced well in advance of  flooding or failure", "823": "Before developing final policies, the Team should ensure that is has the support of those  who have the largest stakes in coastal adaptation,  including those elected officials who must ulti- mately approve and stand behind the plan. Open  public meetings can be used to educate the gen- eral public, coastal property owners and elected  officials about the need for an adaptation plan by presenting the impacts and hazards of sea level  rise, the history of past storm and flooding dam- age, future vulnerabilities, and options for recom- mended adaptation approaches.", "824": "IMPLEMENTING the ADAPTATION PLAN", "825": "Carrying out an adaptation plan requires fund- ing, not only for its initial implementation but  also for periodic updates, since sea level rise is not  a process that will cease at a certain level or on a  specific date in the future. Securing funding may be easiest during times when adaptation to sea  level rise is required by legislation and already on  the agenda of a local government or political body.  Typically, most action or legislation regarding nat- ural hazards takes place immediately following a  large and damaging event and then collective  amnesia sets in and other issues become higher  priorities than sea level rise adaptation planning.  Good examples include the 1989 Loma Prieta  earthquake, and the tsunamis resulting from the  2006 earthquake in Sumatra and in Japan in 2011.  As time passes, funding for area-wide adaptation,  for the execution of regulatory measures and  for those measures requiring large capital invest- ments and follow-up monitoring may be difficult to secure. Some responses to this challenge in- clude tapping into existing complementary organi- zations, (such as coastal management programs),  merging new adaptation policies with planned  coastal development for resilience, and exploring  the use of tourist or user fees", "826": "ONITORING PLAN EFFECTIVENESS One of the most important requirements for  sustained long-term implementation is scien- tific credibility. For example, the general reason- ing in favor of a setback or buffer zone must be backed by data analysis that compares past, cur- rent and projected future sea level rise trends and  the resulting inundation for the areas of concern.  A map that depicts the historic landward migra- tion of a shoreline or bluff edge over time stands as clear evidence that the California coastline is  not static or stationary, and that it is experiencing  a process that will likely that will be amplified in the future.  Once policies are enacted, measures must also be  monitored over time in order to determine their  effectiveness, because stakeholders need to know whether the policies are fulfilling their intended purposes. This may be challenging initially be- cause the rates of change (millimeters per year of  sea level rise and inches or feet per year of coast- line retreat) are still relatively small, and because  it is difficult to determine whether increased wave heights or larger storms are due to climate change  or just part of the normal range of conditions to  be expected.  It will also be useful for a scientist or other techni- cal person on the Team to keep up with the grow- ing wealth of scientific and technical knowledge that is becoming more and more accessible. Be- yond this, the Team should conduct periodic pro- gram reviews to ensure that neighboring commu- nities are aware of one anothers successes and  failures. Local consultants or university research  groups may also be contracted to conduct regu- lar monitoring of affected planning areas in or- der to assess the effectiveness of the adaptation measures in light of rising sea levels, increasing  wave heights and their associated impacts. From  initiation of the sea level rise adaptation planning  process to its completion, it can be challenging to  keep stakeholders involved and engaged through- out the process, depending upon the team ap- proach used.  In some cases, it may be possible and preferable to  first implement small actions or incremental steps in the most vulnerable or hazard-prone areas that  build support for a larger effort, rather than mak- ing drastic changes immediately. However, for  actions requiring formal adoption by multiple en-Page 39 tities, (e.g., special area management plans), it is  best to treat the process as a major public policy  formulation effort from the very beginning. Finally, it is necessary for a Sea Level Rise Pre- paredness Team to ensure that adaptation mea- sures are appropriate for the geographic area of  its community and its specific issues and that the measures achieve their intended goals. Unfortu- nately, there are many reasons for the failure of  even well-designed and fully implemented mea- sures. Poor execution, overly conservative design  and poor construction can all lead to failure. In or- der to avoid such pitfalls, the Team should engage  an engineer and a geoscientist in the preparation  of standards and formulation of designs while us- ing a performance-based approach to policies and  actions that focuses on outcomes.", "827": "EVALUATING ADAPTATION MEASURES One of the most critical considerations is  whether the actions carried out by imple- mentation of a Sea Level Rise Adaptation Plan  decrease the communitys vulnerability to sea  level rise and its associated impacts as identified in the original Plan. Evaluating progress in terms  of reducing vulnerability will be difficultinitially be- cause the impacts of a rising sea level and increas- ing storm wave climate may take years to become  obvious or recognizable. With a short timeframe,  it is also difficult to determine whether increased wave heights or larger storms are due to climate  change or just part of the normal range of climate  variability. In general, it is prudent to keep track  of any unexpected problems, obstacles or delays  associated with adaptation actions, as well as any  unintended positive or negative consequences. Another important consideration is that sea level  rise preparedness is a long-term and continuous  process. A Team must adjust its original assump- tions as natural, social, economic and political  conditions change. For instance, a Team will likely  come across new scientific information or data that could improve and possibly change its under- standing of its communitys vulnerability to sea  level rise. Science advisors should be consulted in  order to determine whether new findings are rel- evant to the community and its adaptive capacity  and whether they should influence changes in the Adaptation Plan", "828": "I n addition to monitoring and evaluating prog- ress for adaptation measures, the Team should  be able to determine whether its communitys  technical capacity to prepare for sea level rise has  increased. The Team may identify the number of  technical experts in its community (or outside sci- ence advisors) who provide guidance on the latest  information about sea level rise impacts in prior- ity planning areas. It could also track the regular  use of ongoing forums for sharing the latest sea  level rise impact information with key local agen- cy staff, the business community and the general public. In addition, the Team should be able to  show the degree to which sea level rise data is  considered in decisions and preparedness actions  for areas of high vulnerability. The Team can also  determine whether there are sufficient resources (e.g., amount of available funds, etc.) in place for  performing vulnerability and risk assessments, im- plementing preparedness actions and evaluating  progress", "829": "SHARING RESULTS As a Team improves upon its preparedness ac- tions, it should share its results with appropri- ate local government staff, elected officials and the public. Transparency and accountability will  help the Team and the public recognize that im- plementation of the Adaptation Plan achieves its  goals. This will provide the city, county, state, and  federal governments with solid evidence that a  Teams actions deserve funding and political sup- port. In addition, publicizing positive results and  benefits can help to improve community partner- ships, and provide a mechanism for sharing infor- mation on the effectiveness or benefits of the plan with other coastal communities.

Another piece of information that can help groups decide which assets are most in need of protection is a vulnerability assessment. You can view a range of vulnerability assessment reports in the Reports section of this site. Groups facing multiple threats often choose to engage risk management experts to study their systems and report on vulnerabilities. For initial explorations, groups can rate sensitivity and adaptive capacity to categorize assets' vulnerability. Sensitivity is the degree to which a population or asset is susceptible or resistant to impacts from weather or climate events.

Rationale: what is the insight provided by the rationale,  quantitative scores, or data source for the scores? E.G.

Climate change is  already having observable effects on the environment, and past conditions are no longer  a reliable indication of the type or extent of disasters communities will face in the future.  As more and more communities face the effects of natural disasters, decision makers  and community members need tools and guidance to help them take action that can  both protect them from natural disasters while also creating great places to live, work,  and play. This Regional Resilience Toolkit provides:    A coordinated process for meeting many different state and federal planning  requirements.    Communication and outreach guidance and resources for engaging a broad coalition  of stakeholders across a region.    Guidance for project teams who are conducting vulnerability assessments, writing  required plans, and implementing projects.    Clear information and tools that can be used with an advisory group and to bring in  decision makers and community leaders to guide the overall action plan and ensure  its successful implementation.    Detailed appendices with worksheets to help inform and guide work, as well as  additional information and resources for each step.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission/Association of Bay Area  Governments (MTC/ABAG) have partnered to create this Regional Resilience Toolkit.  These partners used an approach to regional-scale planning and action for disaster resil- ience that was originally developed in the Bay Area. These materials were then used to  help two other regional partners, the City of Mt. Shasta (and neighboring towns) and the  Central Coast Climate Collaborative. EPA and FEMA worked with these two pilot regions Page 4 | Regional Resilience Toolkit Introduction to test how well the materials worked in other geographic, demographic, and political  contexts.  The City of Mt. Shasta and the Central Coast Climate Collaborative both requested assis- tance in building regional resilience. The assistance included a short-term engagement  with one on-site workshop, and each partner region received a next steps memo about  how to implement disaster resilience actions. With the help of regional partners and  participants, the Toolkit has been revised and updated to reflect lessons learned from  these pilots.  One key lesson from the two pilots was that state-level policies can really spur along local  and regional resilience action because jurisdictions are given new tools, guidance, and  even funding support to plan for natural hazards. For example, the California legislature  has passed a series of bills that create incentives and requirements for local governments  to consider natural hazards and environmental justice and equity as part of routine plan  updates. See Figure 26 for more details on these policies. However, any jurisdiction in any  state can still use existing plans and processes to improve community safety, livability,  and long-term resilience. The Toolkit is intended for any jurisdiction, no matter the size or capacity or hazards they  may face now or in the future. The Toolkit is set up to allow multiple jurisdictions and  levels of government to work together for regional scale actions. It is also designed for  non-governmental partners and community groups to engage in a more inclusive and  holistic process so that resilience actions are guided by core community values. This Toolkit and its steps are designed to fulfill requirements for Local Hazard Mitigation  Plan (LHMP) approval and update, and closely follows FEMAs Local Mitigation Planning  Handbook1. Rather than solely identifying community assets, this process encourages a  more in-depth approach to conducting a vulnerability assessment and selecting hazard  mitigation actions. This is intended to help shape each assessment according to a  communitys preferred goals for a more locally meaningful and actionable LHMP.", "1003": "Resilience is about building the capacity of the community, at various scales, to prepare  for, withstand, recover, and maintain its identity in the face of actual or anticipated  hazard occurrences, allowing for continuity of community and quick recovery if a disaster  occurs", "1004": "  An understanding of why trust is so important, and how to build it   Tools for effective storytelling   A Stakeholder Map that includes your project team, advisory group, leadership and  decision makers, interest groups, and the broader community   An Engagement and Outreach Plan that identifies goals, target audiences, key  messages, tools for outreach, strategies for outreach, and an implementation plan", "1005": "STEP 2.

Who?  The first step is to inventory and identify stakeholders who should be involved,  including the broader public and groups who are often underrepresented and hard to  reach. Engage a broad range of stakeholders with the necessary expertise, values, and  viewpoints at each stage of assessment and implementation.  What? The lead agency will need to identify what each stakeholder or stakeholder groups role is  in the resilience building process, in implementing strategies, and within the community.  When (or how often)? For the identified stakeholders, determine the level of input and outreach that is appro- priate and necessary based on their desired level of engagement and planning role. Align  stakeholder expectations with the planning requirements and required level of outreach  budget and resources available. How? The next step is to determine the best approaches to engaging and reaching the stake- holders. Certain processes, and certain stakeholders may prefer a traditional formal  outreach approach while others prefer digital tools, videos, short interactions, or other  mechanisms.  ", "1011": "Inclusivity and Equity Identifying underrepresented audiences is challenging. Each community is different,  but often non-English speakers, disadvantaged communities, Native Americans/tribal  communities, the homeless, and other groups can be left out of or choose not to partic- ipate in planning efforts. This can be due to disillusionment with government and related  processes, lack of interest, time, and resources to participate, limited information about  an issue, and lack of information about the relevance of a plan to their lives. Disasters  that create the most significant impacts often disproportionately affect environmental  justice communities. EPA defines environmental justice as the fair treatment and  meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income,  with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental  laws, regulations, and policies. Inclusion, equity, and authentic engagement require the  active and comprehensive participation of these audiences.", "1012": "Establish a Common Understanding The process should result in a plan built on community values that also meets the  plans primary objectives. Many planning processes seem abstract to stakeholders and  focus on issues that do not resonate with community members. While stakeholders and  the community may be interested in climate change, is climate action a priority? Will it  drive them to participate, to commit resources, or time to address risk solutions?  Using the climate action plan example, a community may be more interested in the  development of jobs than greenhouse gas reduction. The climate action plan can align  with this value by integrating and prioritizing initiatives that support the development  of jobs, such as training of a green energy workforce to install solar panels and conduct  energy efficiency upgrades. Understanding and addressing community values helps the  project team develop actions that support the goals of the plan while meeting the needs  of the community.", "1013": "Best Practices to Establish a Common Understanding Meet communities where they are and honor what they value. Leverage existing  partner meetings and processes as a means to introduce the project. For community  members, this can mean going to a farmers market, holiday event, health fair, school,  church event, or setting up shop in a local caf or brewery. For more technical stake- holders it can mean attending another organizations staff meeting or partnering on a  relevant but separate planning effort.  Identify what we love and what we want to protect. Begin a dialogue in a  community workshop, survey, or small group setting by asking what people love and  what they want to protect.  Move beyond the workshop. What are the communitys specific preferences for  engagement and sustained interactions? Traditional meetings and workshops are too  often a one-way communication from professional staff to residents and do not lead  to the type of interactive, dynamic dialog that is crucial to a plan that will be broadly  supported by different stakeholders.", "1014": "Conduct stakeholder interviews. Connect with the formal and informal leaders, partner  organizations, and community members through informational and discovery interviews.  Interviews are excellent mechanisms to better discuss and understand underlying issues  or concerns in a discrete way and can be an effective means to engage people who may  be advocates or adversaries.  Launch immersive listening sessions with diverse stakeholder groups. Conduct small  group meetings with invited stakeholders, arranged around a topic or cohort group (e.g.,  schools, businesses, environmental groups, etc.) to uncover issues and opportunities.", "1015": "Tell the Story If you need someone to back your innovation, invest in your idea, or get excited about  following your lead, you need to tell a great story. - IDEO, Storytelling for Influence While listening is a substantial part of successfully engaging stakeholders, it is equally  critical to ensure that project teams and other project representatives are communicating  the right information, at the right time, to the right people. One of the most successful  approaches is telling a story. Project teams can use stories as a frame for communication,  to orient and design project information for the specific audience, and help move the  audience to action by connecting on a more personal level. Figure 15 illustrates four vital  elements for a range of communication channels (e.g., press conference, funding pitch,  workshop, or one-on-one meeting, etc.).  ", "1016": "Best Practices to Tell a Story Grab attention: Get peoples attention and help them to recognize the point of the  communication. Grabbing peoples attention is essential  through a remarkable fact,  a surprising comparison, or a visual. Tie it to the point of the story within the first 30  seconds. For example, a good start might be, My uncles home burned down in the  2017 Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County, California. Not only were his home and personal life  impacted, whole neighborhoods and communities were destroyed.  This offers a signif- icant fact that is attention grabbing and then quickly connects it to action. Engage and relate to audience: Directly relate the story to the audience and what  resonates with them so that the listener becomes engaged and interested. To be  effective, use specific information about the community, organization, or person.  Continuing the example above, one could say, Our local fire department helped to fight  in that fire and many of you in this room lost properties in these historic fires. Core story: Develop the meat of the story with core elements, details, and facts. Organize  the core story into succinct pieces  three is a manageable number  with clear connec- tions to the storys point and to help hint at what the call to action might be. The example  might continue, The Tubbs Fire wasnt unique. In 2017 alone, California experienced  9,133 fires that burned over 1.3 million acres. And we can expect to see more of the same  in the years ahead.", "1017": "Call to action: Tie the entire story together with a strong call to action. This is perhaps  the most important step. Reiterate the key point and connect it to what the ask is. An  ask can be for funding, for a meeting, for support, or for an opportunity to follow up.  The call to action not only provides a take away for the audience but also provides an  opening to re-engage and to follow up on the ask. Finally, the example story would  wrap up with, As a community, we need to band together to be better prepared, protect  people, and reduce the potential damage to our town.", "1018": "Stakeholder Mapping Stakeholder mapping is the process of understanding perspectives and interests,  visualizing relationships, and establishing which stakeholders are the highest priority  for engagement. It may quickly become evident that many people could and should  be involved in the planning effort. However, it is essential to differentiate the various  audiences based on their level of interest and engagement, what level of technical under- standing and input they have, and what level of resources are available to reach and  engage the various groups.  The following are examples of criteria to consider in identifying technical and community  audiences:    The stakeholder owns an important asset.   The stakeholder has the authority to regulate, make policy, or make decisions about  an asset or asset class.   The stakeholder will be affected by the assessment or potential strategies.   The stakeholder has the potential to either help or hinder the political process.    The stakeholder has specialized expertise that will help with technical questions.   The stakeholder may be able to provide funding or otherwise assist in implementing  strategies.   The stakeholder represents typically underrepresented community members.   The stakeholder may be able to make critical connections to other relevant topic  areas and/or projects which the project team is unaware.    The stakeholder has the time and ability to commit time and effort to the project.", "1019": "Map partners to identify trusted and influential actors.  Key partners may include a city council aide, faith groups, community organizations,  skeptics, and social media influencers, among others; the lead agency will need to create  a baseline and evolving set(s) of partners to engage in specific ways. Creating a map of  all of the potential players is a good start to creating a stakeholder engagement strategy.

The objective of the assessment is to determine where hazards and community assets  intersect and to determine what the potential impacts are at that intersection - or what is  the assets vulnerability and risk to hazards. In the assessment, make sure to consider:   Does asset vulnerability include impacts to people (especially disadvantaged commu- nities), to the economy, and to the environment?   Do seemingly unimportant assets provide support to a critical asset?   Who controls the asset and how does that affect mitigation efforts?

The assessment can be done using any number of data sources and tools that already  exist. Project teams can coordinate with state agencies or other entities to access appro- priate data.

Are there multiple lenses?   How should the team measure a successful process?    Is this project a stand alone project or will there be multiple small assessments with  different stakeholders as part of a larger project?   How can this effort tie to the other planning efforts and amplify potential outcomes? The answers to these questions can help identify and focus the scope of the project,  including determining the geographical area, priorities and draft goals that will help  shape the extent of the project, and desired outcomes.

The trigger provides the motivation to do resilience building work. The Toolkit  was developed primarily to help communities that are triggered by the LHMP process,  but users will be able to apply this process to any risk and vulnerability assessment, no  matter the trigger. Below are some of the most common triggers for undergoing a risk  and vulnerability assessment. Recent disaster. Sometimes resilience building is triggered by either a local disaster or  a high profile disaster elsewhere, that wakes up jurisdictions and causes them to realize  that they must take action to reduce the risk.  Regulatory landscape. The entry point to resilience building may be triggered by regula- tions, which include specific requirements about what the assessment should include.  (See Figure 26 for an example of regulatory triggers in California.) Local or national trends. A high visibility local, state, or national thought leader can help  trigger others to conduct resilience planning. This can be especially true when it comes to  climate adaptation, as there is a general understanding of the regional nature of sea level  rise and other climate hazards. Business and investment. A visible, public process to assess the communitys risks and  to be responsive to them is a clear signal to the business and insurance community of the  citys commitment to long-term resilience and viability.  ", "1029": "Establish Resilience Goals Developing effective resilience goals is an important step to establish a common  foundation for stakeholders, the project team, and decision makers. Goals also offer a  touchstone throughout the project to assess if strategies and implementation priorities  align with the communitys needs and desires. Establishing common resilience goals  assist in:    Building transparency into the process at the outset so that all participants under- stand the breadth of priorities and topics to cover.    Engaging the project team early in deciding what shared outcomes they will work  cooperatively to achieve and provide an opportunity for them to ask their stake- holders for input and feedback on the project direction.

Connecting to metrics and aid in tracking and monitoring progress of the  project through implementation. Leveraging existing community goals, such as those in a local compre- hensive plan, can help ensure alignment, and can rally a broader base of  support amongst stakeholders who have already bought into existing  goals or priorities. Further, linking existing goals to resilience goals  can provide additional impetus and support to advance broad  community goals.", "1030": "Setting Resilience Goals Goals may be driven by a desire to protect:   Physical areas (e.g., new development along the shoreline, natural resource areas  or assets)   Asset classes (e.g., critical services)   Social values (e.g., protecting parks because beauty and recreation are highly  held values)   Economic values (e.g., protecting major economic drivers like large businesses)   Character, history, sense of place (e.g., protecting historic structures  or neighborhoods)   Existing functions/activities (e.g., preserving the function of an airport or seaport)   Specific communities (e.g., vulnerable populations) Use the following questions to help refine broad goals.   Does everyone understand the goal? Is it written in clear language? Are there multiple  ways to interpret the goal?    Who is responsible for implementation? Does the lead agency have influence or  ability to achieve the goal? Are the resources, skill, and knowledge available to achieve  the goal?   How does the team know when a goal has been achieved? Is there a milestone that  has been reached? An amount of money spent? An action achieved?   Can the jurisdictions involved realistically achieve that goal? If not, what is more likely?    Is it clear what the result or outcome is from achieving the goal?   When should the goal be achieved? Is there a specific date or timeframe that can be  established as a target? Should there be a mid-term timeframe?", "1031": "Identify and Map Hazards Before conducting a risk and vulnerability assessment, identify and describe the hazards  that are or may be present within the community. An important part of this step is identi- fying which hazards pose the greatest threat to the community. You can qualitatively  estimate which hazards will have the most impact by considering the extent of exposure  (this can be measured by the number of people exposed, number of buildings exposed,  or the value of assets exposed), the consequences of a hazard, and the likelihood of the  hazard occurring.    Discuss the types of hazards to be considered - natural hazards (e.g. wildfires, earth- quakes), man-made hazards (e.g. cyber attacks, terrorism).    Review maps and information of hazards predicting and depicting current and future  flooding, wildfire risk areas, landslide risk areas, or earthquake ground shaking or  liquefaction risk, etc.    Understand past hazard patterns. Where have they struck and how often?   Talk to emergency managers as well as operations and maintenance staff who will  have knowledge of areas most frequently affected.   Identify the hazards most likely to impact the community.   Identify changes that may intensify or increase the possibility of hazards.   Use climate change data to anticipate how hazards may change in the future,  including the intensity and frequency of hazards, as well as how the community will  be impacted by new and unfamiliar hazards.", "1032": "Develop Hazard Impact Statements Develop written descriptions that describe the extent, probability, and expected severity  of the hazard. This can help succinctly summarize hot spots or areas with multiple  hazards that should receive special attention in assessment or strategy development.  These descriptions are often called hazard impact statements. As an example, a hazard statement might read: The western portion of the city has  very high liquefaction susceptibility while the remainder of the city has a low likelihood  of liquefaction. Liquefaction may occur in earthquakes with very high levels of shaking,  including one from the Hayward fault, which runs adjacent to the city and has a high  probability of occurring in the next thirty years.  ", "1033": "Prioritize Hazards To complete the risk assessment, prioritize the hazards that could have the most impact  on the community. This will help determine which assets will need the most robust  assessment (based on exposure to prioritized hazards), can help understand the overlap  between high priority hazards and vulnerable populations, or can help engage certain  stakeholders.  Once the hazards are prioritized it is a good time for the project team to consider if  it is necessary to refine or reprioritize the goals previously outlined. In addition, now  that it is understood where hazards may affect the community use that information to  guide the remainder of the risk assessment, including which assets should be considered  and what information needs to be gathered.", "1034": "Select Assets Hazards become meaningful when they interact with assets. Community assets  include the people, structures, facilities, and infrastructure systems that have value to  the community. (e.g., a tsunami only poses a risk when it lands in an area with bridges,  homes, and wastewater facilities.) Some questions to consider when determining  community assets:   What are the places and elements that the community loves?   Which assets are critical to maintaining safety, health, and productivity in the  community?   Are there unique or critical facilities that the community relies upon?   Which assets would have significant consequences to the community if they failed?   How much information is available on each asset to guide your assessment? Which  assets lack enough data to do a meaningful assessment?    How do goals relate to specific assets or asset classes?", "1035": "Scope Matters The type of assets to be included in an assessment should be broad enough to ensure  that the consequences of hazards on people where they live, work, access key services,  and conduct other day-to-day activities will be fully considered. Assets can be grouped  and assessed in three ways, which will influence the level of detail and effort required for  the assessment:  Individual asset: A unique or critically important asset for which assessment findings  would differ from other assets. For example, a power plant or major thoroughfare may  be individual assets. Representative asset: Assessment findings would be similar across a group of similar  assets and would streamline the assessment process. For example, elementary schools  may have very similar vulnerabilities across a jurisdiction. So instead of assessing each  site, the assessment can be for the cross-section to reveal potential vulnerabilities  inherent in all schools. Individual assets might have issues specific to their location  for  ", "1036": "example, one elementary school might be near a flood plain while another might have  only one road leading to it. Those issues should be considered when necessary. Asset class: An asset class is a categorization of similar assets in one group. Figure 31  shows five classes: community and people; critical services; built environment; economy;  and natural environment. Categorizing a class of assets allows jurisdictions to develop  goals and strategies that may address the broad grouping. For instance, for community  and people, a goal could be zero loss of life in disaster.", "1037": "Not Sure Which Approach is Best? It can be confusing to know what assets should be assessed and at what scale. It may be  helpful to do an exploratory assessment of an asset class to gain some basic information  about the class to determine if there is a need to explore individual assets, or represen- tative assets, more closely. This can be because of physical vulnerabilities, like greater or  more urgent exposure to hazards than anticipated, or because there are some complex  governance issues, like ownership or regulations, that require more attention. The  project team may also start down an assessment path and find that it is not uncovering  any meaningful information. For example if many individual assets are similar and show  similar vulnerabilities, it may not make sense to do an assessment of each individual  asset but instead use one assessment as a representative for that type of asset.  Be sure to leave some room for adjustments as findings emerge. Sometimes a vulner- ability assessment may start to present a compelling storyline, and it makes sense to  tell the story of risk through a certain lens, such as within a specific geographic area, or  a critical asset class. Some uncertainty about exactly what assets to assess is normal at  the scoping phase  eventually, a storyline will emerge, and it is the project teams job to  listen to it and guide the assessment to help it be told.", "1038": "Determine Assessment Method The depth and scope of a vulnerability assessment can vary significantly and will depend  on community goals, the availability of data and information, resources to conduct the  assessment, and individual interests of the jurisdiction and its residents. Looking at  other vulnerability assessments is a good first step for establishing base informational  requirements. The simplest assessment includes an exposure analysis, which maps hazards on top of  locations of key assets to identify a potential hazard. This approach requires at least a list  of key assets, their locations, and an overlay map of hazards located in the assessment  area. More information about an assets vulnerability can transform an assessment into a  compelling story that sets up targeted, meaningful actions.  However, more detailed information on assets can help uncover the vulnerabilities  and consequences for key assets and provides a better platform for identifying hazard  mitigation and climate adaptation strategies to address hazards. Because it is important  to understand what will happen to assets and the people and services that rely on them  if they are exposed to a hazard, the project team may want to go beyond the exposure  analysis and collect vulnerability information on the assets. This can be achieved through  answering a series of assessment questions about the asset.   At a minimum, assess emergency response facilities and critical public facilities related  to essential services such as police, fire, water, and power.   A more comprehensive assessment may include residential units, infrastructure  systems, and/or recreational spaces.   The most comprehensive approach would be to evaluate all assets individually, but  this will likely require more resources. Project teams may take a simplified approach  by choosing a representative asset to assess that may be similar to many others,  house important services, or serve a large number of residents. If assessing a repre- sentative asset is not possible, asset classes can be assessed with far fewer resources,  but can still provide information useful for the community.", "1039": "Exposure Analysis An exposure analysis is a deeper dive within the larger risk and vulnerability assessment  to focus in on specific impacts to selected assets. It helps identify which assets will be  exposed to a specific hazard and provides a basic understanding of the magnitude  of possible damage or loss after a disaster. For example, an exposure analysis can  determine how many housing units are likely to be exposed to an earthquake and  provide a high level estimate of the economic effects. An exposure analysis involves combining the location and extent of the hazards  with the location of assets. This is generally done through Geographic Information  System (GIS) mapping using pre-identified hazard scenario map layers and mapped  community asset locations. There are five key steps to the exposure analysis (See  Appendix A for more details): 1. Add relevant hazard layers into a new or existing map in ARCGIS (or similar tool). 2. Gather data and map the locations of the community assets included in the  assessment scope. 3. Compare assets to the hazard layers. 4. Create maps showing the extent of hazards and the location of assets that intersect  with those hazards. (See Figure 33) 5. Ask those with local knowledge and experience to help pinpoint locations that are not  accurate and need further analysis.", "1040": "Add relevant hazard layers into a new or existing map in ARCGIS (or similar tool).", "1041": "Answer Assessment Questions Assessment questions help describe the existing conditions, different types of vulnerabil- ities, and consequences that may occur if an individual or representative asset is exposed  to a specific hazard. There are separate assessment questions for individual or repre- sentative assets and asset classes, so be sure to use the correct assessment questions  worksheet for the appropriate scale.  Assessment questions include describing and determining the following information:   Ownership and characteristics of an asset   Existing conditions    Physical vulnerabilities to hazards   Functional vulnerabilities including dependencies or relationships to other assets    Governance vulnerabilities   Consequences if asset is damaged or destroyed", "1042": "Develop Profile Sheets Describe the asset or asset class. Describe the key functions of the asset or asset class,  the geographic extent of it, who it serves, and any other relevant information. Describe key issues. Identify pressing issues such as vulnerable populations that may  be affected, very high risk areas, or significant financial consequences.  Describe the vulnerabilities. List all of the vulnerabilities uncovered. There are a few  basic categories that can help organize vulnerability types:   Information. Poor data/information can hinder understanding of vulnerability and  risk, or can affect the ability to achieve mitigation or adaptation strategies.   Governance. Identify characteristics such as inadequate authority or regulatory  mechanisms, inadequate or unavailable sources of funding, or lack of mechanisms  to address issues affecting multiple sectors, jurisdictions, or communities.    Functions. Identify functions, roles, or relationships that make assets especially  vulnerable. For example, a senior facility may be more vulnerable than an  office building because of its function and the dependence on outside services.  Functional vulnerabilities could include lack of system redundancy, dependence  on vulnerable assets, the function of the asset itself, or the assets position in a  networked system.   Physical. Physical vulnerabilities that make an asset acutely sensitive or limit its  ability to withstand hazards. This could include water sensitivity or buildings that  are built to older codes that are known to perform poorly in disasters. Describe the short-, mid- and long-term consequences.

Describe the effects on important elements of the regional economy,  such as impacts to goods and movement of people, employment centers, and  business sectors. ", "1043": "Summarize Vulnerability After completing the risk assessment, summarize the findings to identify the most  significant risks in the community. These findings or problem statements will help to  craft effective strategies and actions. Problem statements will help to:   Communicate critical planning issues, for example which critical assets are particu- larly vulnerable, what areas currently have repetitive losses, or how many high hazard  areas are currently zoned for future development.   Assist the community and stakeholders to prioritize and focus on the areas that have  the greatest need for mitigation or adaptation based on the risk assessment.    Create a clear and cogent story to help support decision making by elected officials  and other stakeholders.   Provide a foundation for seeking funds to reduce risks and increase community  resilience.", "1044": "The first step in writing problem statements is to review the exposure analysis maps and  answers to the assessment questions. It is often the case that a number of assets will  have similar characteristics, conditions and challenges, so it makes sense to read through  and reflect on all of the answers before beginning to summarize. The second step is to use the answers to the assessment questions to write summary  statements describing the vulnerabilities and consequences identified. Depending on the  process, the statements can summarize the assessment findings for individual assets,  a particular asset category or services, the community as a whole, or the agencies and  organizations that own, operate, or manage the assets evaluated. When writing problem statements, consider what vulnerabilities or consequences to  include, and if a stand alone problem statement is most effective. Some vulnerabilities  will rise to immediate or near-term need, such as those that have:   Broad or wide ranging effects on society and equity, including to a large geographic  area, large numbers of residents, or to environmental justice communities.   Reduce ecosystem benefits provided by natural areas, such as flood risk reduction,  water quality improvement, and supporting biodiversity.   Economic impacts at multiple scales, including local, regional, statewide and national.   Urgency and complexity, which requires a longer timeframe to address.

Cascading effects on other assets, services, or communities. This is particularly an  issue for networked assets, such as transportation, utilities, and shoreline protection,  which are interconnected in a manner such that failure of one part of the system will  disrupt the rest of the system. This will also be an issue for assets that rely on other  assets to maintain functionality, for example hospitals, nursing homes, and waste- water treatment plants that rely on uninterrupted power supplied by others.", "1045": "Develop Strategies Once the vulnerability assessment is complete, develop strategies and specific actions  and projects to address the vulnerabilities. It is important to ensure that the strategies  are actionable, feasible, flexible, and that they are built on the communitys long-term  vision and values, and link to the plans goals (see figure below). Consider these best  practices in developing strategies:   Link strategies directly to problem statements: strategies offer the solutions to the  problems identified in the risk assessment.    Select fewer, more actionable strategies rather than a long laundry list of potential  actions.    Address multiple problems or vulnerabilities with a single strategy.   Ensure that there is someone who can be the lead on a strategy - someone who has  the authority, political will, ability, time, and resources to make it happen.    Directly align strategies with resilience goals outlined at the beginning of the process.", "1046": "Develop Initial List of Strategies This step focuses on developing an initial list of potential strategies that are responsive  to specific problem statements. Strategies at this point should be robust enough to be  able to move forward, but flexible and adaptable enough to adjust as they are advanced.  Each kind of problem may have different approaches or types of strategies required. The  following are examples of ways to categorize and consider strategies.   Operational  Strategies to enact operational and governance-related improvements.   Programmatic - Strategies to expand or create new programs , activities, and  initiatives.   Plans, regulations, and policy development  Strategies to develop or revise  policies, plans, regulations, and guidelines.   Capital improvement/infrastructure projects - Strategies designed to address  physical and functional deficiencies and needs in the built and natural environment.    Education/outreach/coordination  Strategies related to initiating or expanding  partnerships and relationships, communicating and sharing information, and building  awareness.   Evaluation  Strategies to improve feedback, input, and data and information or  conduct further or new analyses. The process of developing a basic profile of each potential strategy can help to uncover  how easy or feasible the strategy would be to implement. Strategies will vary in terms  of timeliness, dependencies, cost, and effort. Some solutions may be preliminary or  unlocking, meaning they must be done in a particular order. Some strategies may be  easier than others for individual agencies or asset managers to undertake themselves  without having to form new partnerships or collaborations. Some strategies are multi  benefit, providing community benefits or improving the performance of the asset to  multiple hazards. Finally, some strategies should be launched early because they require  a long lead time.", "1047": "Each strategy also has a process or mechanism for implementation that can be identified  early on. Some typical identified processes are listed below:   Long range planning  these are mechanisms like master plans or climate action  plans that articulate a long range vision for the community.   Land use planning  this includes elements that dictate current and future land use  planning decisions like General Plans or Specific/Area plans.   Capital planning  this includes capital improvement plans and is essential if the  strategy requires financial support for staff or capital improvements.   Operations  this includes the annual budgeting process, which can incorporate the  financial planning for strategy implementation.   Emergency and hazards planning  this includes incorporation into the LHMP,  emergency response plans, or preparedness planning.   Project planning and design  this includes public-private development projects like  housing developments, which may be necessary to implement specific strategies.   New initiatives  this includes anything that cannot occur under current processes  and needs an entirely new effort like a new department, legislation, or ballot measure.", "1048": "valuate and Prioritize Strategies Evaluate and decide which of the initial list of strategies are most relevant, most  achievable, or highest priority. Carefully considered evaluation criteria can provide a tool  for prioritization. Evaluation criteria can be an essential tool to gauge the priorities and  values of different agencies, organizations, communities, or other stakeholders to ensure  that strategies are well balanced to reflect the communitys goals. Evaluation criteria  can also reveal new perspectives in how different strategies impact the four frames   society and equity, economy, environment, and governance  or whatever frames the  community has identified. Evaluating strategies through these frames can identify and  highlight the benefits and tradeoffs of strategies in each frame, which can be very useful  when garnering political, community, and financial support for implementation.  The four frames can reveal some of the following characteristics of each strategy:   Society and equity: Effects on communities and the services on which they rely, with  specific attention to disproportionate impacts due to social, political, or economic  inequality.   Economy: Economic aspects that may be affected such as costs of physical infra- structure damages or lost revenues during recovery periods.   Environment: Environmental aspects that may be affected, including ecosystem  functions and services and species diversity.   Governance: Factors such as organizational structure, ownership of assets,  management responsibilities of assets, jurisdictional mandates, regulations, or  funding options that affect how a community can respond to a hazard. The evaluation criteria can be used not just by the project team, but by any individual or  group that will play a significant role in implementation. Vetting and evaluating strategies  are a key piece of community outreach to ensure that the plan for building resilience  represents what the community wants and needs for a safer future. Additionally, various  city departments may have different perspectives on things like ease of implementation,  and identifying potential issues during the evaluation phase can help prevent unexpected  roadblocks in the future. Strategy evaluation is also another chance to build buy-in and  support from decision makers and the community.", "1049": "Building Consensus on Priorities  If many strategies rate similarly, the following questions may help identify top priorities:   Is it aligned with other ongoing or planned efforts? Can the city adapt projects  already underway to include mitigation or adaptation efforts, or if the city imple- ments the strategy does it meet multiple goals?   Is it an easy win? An easy win is a strategy that is easy to achieve and provides a  high level of benefit.   Is it an unlocking strategy? For example, are additional studies required or new  stakeholders needed before the city can implement a priority strategy?   Is the timing right? For instance, if the regular building code update is due in the  next year, it may make sense to prioritize a strategy to update the building code  to take climate change projections into account within that same process and  time frame.   Is there a champion? Is there someone who strongly believes it is a top priority  and is willing and able to devote time and resources to implement it in the short  term? Refer to Worksheet 3.3 Evaluation Criteria that can be adapted to match the project and  the communitys resilience goals.", "1050": "evelop Implementation Plans The entire planning process should be done with an eye to implementation, working  to overcome challenges and build consensus throughout to facilitate successful imple- mentation. Once there is a list of prioritized and actionable strategies, the next step is to  develop an implementation plan. Implementation can be considered in two parts:  Implementation is a critical part of sustaining resilience over the long-term, ensuring  ongoing support and funding for future projects and initiatives. Below are some best  practices to use as the project team develops implementation plans.    Connect implementation to the goals and process completed to get to this point.    Understand the needs and wants of stakeholders and community members.    Use survey and polling to gauge broad support for plans and actions.   Build support for the value of the plan to increase buy in and increase stakeholders  investment in the outcome.    Plan on a lot of ongoing public outreach and education to remind people about the  effort and how it connects to their lives.    Time projects when the atmosphere is right. Modify the timeframe identified in the  plan as needed to benefit from external conditions. A Long-Term Implementation Plan (5-20 years) is typically higher level, and used to  share with stakeholders and decision makers, is included in formal plan documents, and  illustrates how to achieve the vision and plan goals.  A Short-Term Action Plan (0-5 years) can act as a staff level working plan that details  each step or tactic necessary to achieve those longer term goals and vision in a more  manageable time frame, up to 2 years. There is a direct link between the action plan and  annual budgets, the capital improvements plan, and daily work.", "1051": "Develop Long-Term Implementation Plan The long-term implementation plan (5-20 years) should map out the activities, priorities,  timing, and costs for each strategy. This builds the overarching framework for imple- mentation, ensuring that the implementation plan hits on all the high level goals. The  long-term plan comes first so that the short-term action plans are designed to implement  and enable the vision laid out in the long-term plan. Use the implementation plan as the final chance to ground truth the feasibility and  effectiveness of a solution. If a strategy has been moved forward to this point, and it is  more aspirational than realistic, adjust the implementation to reflect that reality.  ", "1052": "Develop Short-Term Action Plans Building upon the Long-Term Implementation Plan, a Short Term Action Plan with a 0-2  or even 5 year time frame should be the next step. This near term planning tool should  integrate financing, and assist in routine city decision making while still maintaining the  long-term vision of the implementation plan. The Short-Term Action Plan should include  specifics and tactical details that go into city work plans, budgets, and grants planning.  Planning for implementation will also use the pieces of information filled in on  Worksheet 3.5 Strategy Development and Implementation and shown as an example  on the following page; the strategy types and process/implementation mechanism  portions can be particularly helpful in identifying actions or activities. A Short-Term Action  Plan should include the following information:   Strategy name   Specific actions or tactics to implement strategy   Information on the lead, cost, level of effort or estimated hours to complete, funding  source, and completion date   A status line that can be updated periodically   Metric or an evaluation measurement by strategy or tactics depending on the  required detail ", "1053": "Catalysts for Implementation Implementation is the most difficult part of any planning effort. Many partners can get  behind a concept, but when it comes to dedicating funding, time, or resources, it can  be a challenge. The process identified in this Toolkit is designed to help avoid common  pitfalls, particularly inadequate engagement of stakeholders, decision-makers and the  community. The following are some best practices to adhere to when developing imple- mentation plans: 1. Political buy in. Elected officials, like council members, have the power to expedite or  stymie action. Building a supportive political climate and addressing the concerns of  elected officials or other decision makers can make the difference between action and  inaction.  2. Sustained commitment. Many actions can take years to implement. Projects may  span multiple terms of office for elected officials and multiple funding cycles. It helps  to have an advocate at a high level (see above point about political buy-in), but beyond  elected officials, who may cycle in and out of office before a project is complete,  engagement of department heads, city administrators, city managers, or someone  similar helps ensure implementation success.  3. Focus actions where the money is. Varying priorities from funders means that  sources of funding may not align with all actions identified and prioritized. Rather than  focusing on an action without regard to where funding will be coming from, select  actions that align with funding priorities. (See Step 4. FUND for more on this)  4. Piggyback on successful local projects. What kinds of projects are already successful  in communities? Every community has its own capital spending pattern, which reveals  the priorities of the community. These priorities should have been identified early on  in the project, and strategies and actions should align with existing community prior- ities. It is important to look at existing projects to see where resilience actions may be  able to piggyback.  5. Use existing processes, groups, or sources of funding. Similar to capitalizing on  existing successful projects, consider how existing working groups, departments,  or funding streams can be adapted to include actions that advance resilience. For  example, if a community already has a sustainability council that brings together  cross-agency staff or department heads, that group could expand its mission  to advance resilience as well. Additionally, current investments in infrastructure  Example: Linking Climate Adaptation  and Hazard Mitigation  in Massachusetts In 2018, the state of Massachusetts completed an  integrated State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation  Plan. The plan outlines 108 specific actions that meet the  requirements both for federal disaster mitigation funds  and for the governors executive order requiring the state  to prepare for the impacts of climate change. These 108 actions are scored by priority and have detailed  information about the lead agency, partners, funding  sources, and completion time frame. Key state agencies  will track progress of each action and update and develop  new actions over time.  www.mass.gov/service-details/massachusetts-integrated- state-hazard-mitigation-and-climate-adaptation-plan  (Chapters 7 and 8) Regional Resilience Toolkit | Page 67  Step 3. ACT maintenance may be able to be adapted to incorporate protective actions like water- proofing or seismic retrofit to improve the longevity of infrastructure without the need  for new bond measures or other sources of funding. 6. Consider the citys partners. Many resilience projects are complex, with multiple  owners, regulators, or users of assets that need retrofit, moving, or rebuilding. Create  more realistic solutions by identifying and engaging with all involved stakeholders  from the beginning, and taking into account all of the moving pieces involved in imple- menting a solution.  7. Do not be afraid to build something new. Sometimes it makes more of a statement  and political splash to create an entirely new effort, especially if the effort can garner  a lot of excitement and involvement from a wide variety of stakeholders. For example,  Bay Conservation and Development Commissions 2009 Rising Tides design compe- tition generated region-wide interest in climate adaptation, leading to the devel- opment of the Adapting to Rising Tides Program, which has worked with many cities  and counties since the competition to develop in-depth vulnerability assessments and  sea level rise adaptation strategies for the region.  Every community will need its approach for implementing resilience building actions,  building on existing processes to create adaptive decision making and action taking.  Ensuring successful implementation stems from active engagement of stakeholders,  coordinated decision making, and wide ranging capacity building to minimize barriers to  action and garner meaningful support", "1054": "Figuring out how to fund a project or resilience initiative is a difficult challenge to solve  for almost all jurisdictions. No matter the project, financial hurdles are frequently cited as  the reason for not acting. Building successful funding and financing for resilience starts  with understanding the communitys long-term vision for its future and how collectively  it will commit to funding and implementing its goals. Successful communities will figure  out meaningful ways to mainstream resilience into overall community development and  community visioning.  Adaptive approaches to match resilience needs to funding resources may include uncon- ventional solutions: for example, different departments may coordinate on spending  for capital projects, or neighboring cities may pool funding for large-scale green infra- structure projects to benefit many jurisdictions. Unexpected co-benefits arise from these  imaginative multi-partner efforts  workforce development opportunities, new sources  for potential matching funds, enlivened economic conditions resulting from major  construction projects, and an improved physical environment that uplifts the quality  of life for the community. By highlighting multiple benefits of resilience projects, more  funders are likely to emerge to support implementation.  Project teams can work with the advisory group to develop an overall resilience capital  strategy, which can include several steps to ensure a robust, diverse, and long-term  sustainable plan for funding resilience actions. But project teams will need to first start  by mastering the fiscal landscape with training for key staff and leaders in how to make  the business case for resilience projects. Though many project team and advisory group  members may be able to talk about the need for resilience actions, they will also need to  be able to talk about the cost-benefit analysis, the return on investment, and other such  financial considerations for project success. Furthermore, it is important to have a strong  network of funders that cut across levels of government and include the private and  philanthropic sectors. Lastly, before a capital strategy takes form, the larger community  must be willing to invest in actions that improve overall community resilience.", "1055": "Master the Fiscal Landscape Senior staff and elected leaders will need to develop financial literacy to talk with both  private financers and public agencies about their projects and funding needs. Local  governments can consider setting up a fiscal coaching program for personnel that work  on disaster resilience planning and project action. Training and capacity building on fiscal  issues can ensure that all decision-making officials are conversant with current finance  and funding options that are evolving at a rapid pace. Social investment firms often provide  pro bono training support for clients and community stakeholders. Programs such as the  Urban Land Institutes Pro Forma Fundamentals course provides transferable models for  financial analysis in the real estate sector. There are many ways to support local expertise  and to ensure communities are savvy investors and funders in resilience planning. In the  same way that cities support leadership or equity training programs for staff and super- visors, cities can consider adding fiscal literacy and innovation curricula into professional  development programs to build local proficiency.", "1056": "uild Your Funding Network Making the business case for the resilience effort in the community  planning how to  frame the project, back it up with data and numbers, and convince people to invest in  it  is a critical part of this effort. The project team should devise a clearly articulated  business case for the resilience actions. This will support the larger resilience initiative  and be the means for the community/region to demonstrate the purpose of the work  with information that an audience of financers will need in its deliberations on partnering  and investing. Each project, initiative, and strategy must be sold to decision makers,  partners, and, most importantly, funders. Worksheet 4.1 Funder Engagement  Inventory See Appendix A pages 4.5 - 4.6 for more  details. Regional Resilience Toolkit | Page 73  Step 4. FUND The effort to develop a resilience funding plan is a time-intensive activity that warrants  attention, sustained networking, and ongoing communications with a broad range of  potential fiscal partners. It is realistic to plan for at least two to three years of planning  and project development to successfully secure local and external funding.", "1057": "Best Practices to Develop a Funding Network  Build partnerships and relationships with local groups and those in other sectors  and levels of government. This is a good business practice and knits together critical  social networks used in supporting funding measures, new budget allocations, and for  securing new revenues.   Connect with funding program officers at state agencies to acquaint them with the  communitys resilience action planning and fiscal gaps. Meet with the State Hazard  Mitigation Officer who monitors federal risk reduction programs and manages the  states FEMA funding support for federal mitigation assistance.   Contact the state office of emergency services and regional FEMA Grants teams and  invite them to visit the jurisdictions resilience team, partners, and community  leaders in order to present ongoing action planning efforts and demonstrate local  needs for additional fiscal support.   Keeping up on current policy developments is important: register to receive all  public outreach communications on available grant funding, application  processes, and proposal deadlines. Monitor the agencys social media postings and  funding alerts to ensure having as much information as possible on funding resources,  and place your name on mailing and notice lists for state and federal programs.  Invite staff from federal agencies such as FEMA, EPA, HUD and other potential funding  offices to quarterly briefings about ongoing resilience planning and implementation  needs.   Lead state and federal agency leaders, senior state and federal elected officials and  staff from philanthropic funders on community tours to demonstrate the need for  resilience funding and resources.   Attend commission and governing body meetings of funding agencies and organi- zations on a regular basis to become well versed in their policy priorities; establish a  jurisdictional presence and interest in their proceedings; and, to present information  during public comment periods on the jurisdictions resilience efforts.", "1058": " Track relevant state and federal resilience legislation as well as budget processes  to identify potential sources of resilience funding is another useful tack. Submit  comments through the jurisdictions governing body, pertinent committees, and  legislative representatives on changes in regulation and funding allocations, especially  relevant substantive statewide funding measures.   Encourage the inclusion of resilience policies and actions as eligible funding  activities in the development of state regulations developed after voters approve a  funding measure.   Participate in the public dialogue on the development of regulations that govern  bond and tax disbursements and promote actions that route funds for resilience  implementation.", "1059": "Build Local Support Building and sustaining stakeholder support for resilience action is an essential  component of a finance strategy. As a jurisdiction overhauls its internal spending plan  to incorporate climate and disaster resilience improvements, develops new revenue  sources, or seeks voter approval for tax measures, having solid community backing is a  baseline need. Communities see these efforts as being similar to managing a fundraising  drive or a political campaign. After building trust and involvement through consistent  outreach and frequent public dialogue, a larger support network naturally evolves as  leaders and stakeholders address community risk and develop local solutions that make  sense and are doable. Use Worksheet 4.1 Funder Engagement Inventory. Local officials need to understand effective ways to activate community interest and  ensure they are addressing the communitys highest priority needs. This will assure  voters that they have responsive government partners and they are more readily  invested in resilience outcomes. As outlined above, building a base for community  support calls for astute public outreach.", "1060": "Cultivate internal allies. Local boards and commissions, along with the mayor  and city council/boards of supervisors, exercise considerable authority on budget  decisions, approving grant applications and development of new revenue streams. ", "1061": "Enlist members of these appointed bodies as champions for resilience implemen- tation. Start by identifying the senior leaders whose approval is essential for resilience  projects success.   Develop a briefing plan for senior decision makers to establish program and funding  priorities, and work with the agencys executive team to craft staff level recommenda- tions for resilience actions to present to the jurisdictions governing body. Designate  senior sponsors who can shepherd projects through planning and budget processes  and are trusted figures in the agency and community.  Weave financing for resilience into daily activities. Establish a resilience action  agenda through existing agency planning processes. Identify practical next steps  that align with or improve existing organizational practice; identify innovative ways to  blend/unlock funding for multi-benefit projects. Present these ideas as incremental,  feasible solutions to address long-term challenges that are woven into the annual  budget processes and capital planning budgets.  Enlist the support of community stakeholders and active, local groups. Forging  solid community relationships will be the basis for ongoing support for projects and  financial support for resilience implementation. Build on community initiatives and  link resilience action with other, ongoing local projects and initiatives. This will anchor  resilience in daily community life and grow a larger network for implementation.  Ensure that resilience is a front burner community topic. Develop a consistent  briefing plan for varied stakeholder groups and integrate presentations with standing  meetings to socialize the public consultation process and to ensure that resilience  initiatives are always on the communitys discussion agendas. Make sure senior  officials have a clear understanding of the fiscal challenges the community faces to  improve resilience outcomes.   Conduct participatory budget processes. These are public-private discussions  about community finances that yield solid results that demonstrate community  confidence and partnership. The process is much the same when addressing how to  fund resilience improvements; rallying community support at the outset is essential as  communities internally negotiate how to pay for climate and disaster safety measures.  Whether through electoral campaigns, applying for funds from federal agencies, or by  raising local impact fees, local jurisdictions have crucial financial choices to make to  reduce the risk they face now and in the years to come.", "1062": "Develop a Resilience Capital  Strategy A successful resilience capital strategy is one that marries community- and government- supported funding and financing options into a layered and diverse portfolio of options.  The concept, similar to a capital stack, is based on the understanding that there is an  inherently correct sequence of funding and financing to maximize investments. To  establish an effective capital strategy, the project team must be intentional about its  funding and financing approach from the beginning, and structure its engagement,  project development, communications, and resources in a way to leverage and enhance  the potential to establish a robust and diverse capital strategy. Most cities struggle to  find start-up investments that will bring more partners to the table to scope the project  and lay the groundwork, whether through initial design, property acquisition, permitting,  and other early-stage project phases. Yet these start-up funds are critical to leverage  long-term recovery and pre-disaster funding. Certain investments, such as those from a community foundation or general fund, can be  made early in the process as they require limited return on that investment and are able  to seed additional funding sources, particularly private investments, that need a stronger  foundation and low-risk profile. For resilience projects, particularly large infrastructure  projects, building this funding foundation is essential. Resilience financial planning  must consider the need to secure early, pre-development funds from local government  reserves or budgets, private-sector partners, or philanthropy sources. This leverages  available government funding and keeps initiatives on track.  Communities must consider the overall timing and complicated fiscal process for  bringing disaster resilience projects to fruition. Project teams will need to pinpoint  financial milestones and appropriate funding sequences to implement the project. This  sequencing is tricky to manage, because external government grants are frequently  allocated for projects that are fully planned and designed. An effective resilience capital  strategy often starts with local, self-reliant investments, and leverages those monies with  public-private partnerships, philanthropic dollars, regional funds, grants, and private- sector investments.", "1063": "Self-Reliant Resilience Financing Starting with the inventory of local resources demonstrates community commitment to a  more self-reliant financial future. It also provides local matching funds required for many  federal grant programs and shows private investors that local jurisdictions are serious  about addressing risks and willing to adopt innovative ways to fund community safety.  Use the following common (and not-so-common) tools for local resilience financing.  ", "1064": "Develop an initial financial strategy that starts with locally-based funding opportu- nities. The strategy should consider the following elements:  Embed resilience budgeting into the communitys fiscal planning. As resilience funding  is often limited to external, limited scope grants or restricted portions of general fund  or capital improvement plan budgets, local resources are undervalued. This includes  existing budget planning as part of mainstream operations. Incrementally, resilience  projects and initiatives need to be part of the regular budget and decision-making  discussions.  Examine all funding sources at hand as possible resilience monies that can open  new possibilities to implement projects more quickly. Comb through internal budget  sources and consider how to re-purpose existing funds or create new revenue  scenarios to leverage whats already available.  Influence community-wide conversation and day-to-day decisions about long-term  capital improvements to both inform the public and build support for future funding  campaigns. Every community has an investment approach shaped by local values, identified risks,  and consensus solutions resulting from local dialogue. Developing a zero-based local  budget analysis to closely examine resources at hand can be the gateway to advance a  diverse resilience funding strategy. Start by looking at existing internal processes, groups,  or sources of funding as topics for public consideration that could offer unexpected  answers on how to mainstream resilience projects. Local jurisdictions or regional  agencies with cross-functional project groups or inter-departmental work teams may  be able to incorporate resilience components into ongoing capital projects or planning  initiatives. Projects already poised to be funded and implemented are prime examples  of efforts to review as potential vehicles for readily integrating resilience improvements. ", "1065": "dapting current asset management budgets for infrastructure maintenance might  easily combine protective actions such as weather-proofing or structural improvements  to expand the full lifecycle investment and infrastructure upgrade with little or no extra  funding. This approach is successful when done with a robust participatory process to  balance the perspectives of government and local residents. Once local resources are  scrutinized and realistically assessed as untapped funds for resilience projects, decision  makers can identify additional resilience funding gaps and plan for outside grants or  loans. See Worksheet 4.2 Local Funding Source Inventory Worksheet. It is possible, at the local and state levels, to provide fiscal and resource incentives for  resilience improvements that property owners use to good purpose. Some disaster- experienced communities have funded post-event grants (some funded through FEMA  or the state Office of Emergency Services) for homeowners to use to implement fire and  seismic safety improvements. Other cities have provided permit fee waivers, expedited  approvals and property transfer tax rebates for residential resilience upgrades. New  programs in residential energy and water efficiency offer a promising pathway for  property owners to include disaster safety improvements to their renovation projects.  It is also possible to leverage these sustainability resources with added state and public  utility federal incentives. The following list describes some of the local or regional  financing options that can be used to support resilience projects:.  Existing budgets. Assess for potential resilience funding or to leverage financing  opportunities, including utility user fees, special service taxes, existing general  obligation bond monies, and other operational funds.  Existing infrastructure and community development funds. Review water, public  safety, energy efficiency, retrofit funding, green infrastructure funds, housing, climate  action, and transportation program budgets. Determine how these monies can be  unlocked and combined with other funds to amplify resilience action investments  and achieve supplemental improvements, e.g., improving a buildings energy efficiency  while retrofitting for earthquake resilience.  Bonds. Local jurisdictions can issue municipal and general obligation bonds with voter  approval for taxes assessed on property parcels. Bond proceeds can fund capital  improvements. Other types of bonds include social impact, green, resilience, and  environmental impact bonds.", "1066": " Special tax assessment districts. Use a voter-approved tax district to levy taxes for a  risk-reduction program limited to a particular type of improvement in a defined area.  Such districts can use the funds for capital improvements or operating program uses.  Capital improvements planning budget. Cities develop two-, five-, or ten-year capital  budgets that outline long-term community improvements to infrastructure and opera- tional programs. These budgets can incrementally add resilience actions as they are  refined and adjusted.   Resilience impact fees. A jurisdiction can enact a policy to embed resilience fees in  development entitlements or via building permit process fees. These fees are similar  to other types of entitlement fees such as for affordable housing, parks and open  space, and infrastructure improvements. Fees are charged via the permitting process  and used by the jurisdiction as funding for resilience improvements.   Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) entitlements. It is  possible to repurpose existing federal allocations for higher-impact resilience benefits  as allowable under program guidelines; HUD Disaster Recovery funds are also a  potential source of funds for resilience improvements.  City reserve funds for economic uncertainty. City reserve funds may be used as  collateral for revolving state or federal loan funds, if approved by the jurisdictions  governing body.  Parametric triggered catastrophe insurance. Re-insurance firms offer policies  tailored to address probable disaster impacts in a defined area. When the disaster  strikes, funds are quickly transmitted to the jurisdiction to accelerate recovery  operations.  Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs. PACE energy, PACE seismic and  Pay As You Save (PAYS) on-bill programs are allowable sources of funds to improve  environmental sustainability and resilience. Communities use these established  programs to fund risk reduction/resilience with improvements as allowable under  state law. Property owners borrow capital from private sector lending programs to  install safety and energy improvements. The loan is repaid over a designated period,  included with payment of annual property taxes.  Risk management practices. The jurisdictions risk management staff coordinate  with other jurisdictions on common safety actions through regional risk pools. Staff  can investigate how to work on and accelerate resilience implementation through  these typically well-funded programs that provide internal risk-reduction grants for  member communities.", "1067": "Boundary organization investment Another element in the capital strategy is to create a conduit for donations to the local  government for both disaster recovery and pre-disaster mitigation actions. This can be  done within the local government or through formation of a non-profit, 501 (c) 3 organi- zation to serve as a fiscal agent. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs),  regional land trusts, community foundations, and Community Development Corporations  (CDCs) are all potential partners in the initial project phase.  CDFIs, CDCs, land trusts, and community foundations can form a layer of the stack  that bridges local need to grants, revolving loan funds, or private sector investments.  These boundary organization investments can support the pre-development planning,  environmental review, or entitlements that must be in place for projects to be deemed  shovel ready by grant funders, including federal grants. The Santa Barbara Community  Foundation in Southern California supported recovery planning after the 2017/18  disasters struck. Another example is the Rebuild North Bay organization that supports  fire recovery work to restore regional housing after the 2017 Wine Country Fires. Partnering with a boundary organization can help local governments find early funds to  jumpstart projects. Boundary organizations are common for bridging science and policy,  and these organizations can also function to bring diverse partners together for collabo- ration in areas that neither side is an expert in. In the case of disaster resilience, this  partner can provide start-up, pre-development, and entitlement funds for public sector  infrastructure projects and serve as a bridge to implementation from planning to action. ", "1068": "Curate a Resilience Finance Menu  A layered capital strategy should address how the project will offer multiple benefits,  which will attract the greatest number of potential investors. Funding is all about the  framing of a project to meet the needs of a particular funder. A reliable, long-lasting  funding strategy will often include a variety of funders, and project teams that want to set  up a diverse finance menu may want to:  Develop a feasible public-private finance strategy by connecting with impact  investors, corporate partners, and local financial institutions. Local officials can align  support of private capital as a crucial part of the resilience funding strategy.   Pursue philanthropic and corporate contributors through the private-sector  partnerships and by tapping local community foundations to explore potential funding  through this often underused fiscal source.   Develop regional funding programs.  Secure external grants.", "1069": "Attracting Private Investments Private sector support from impact investors, developing private/public partnerships,  and exploration of the new federal programs can provide an additional layer of project  funding to bolster public sector monies. Programs such as the Department of Treasurys  Opportunity Zone program attract funders to public sector infrastructure investments by  providing investment tax incentives if private sector partners remain for ten years in the  resilience venture. The underused private sector investment is a promising opportunity  that communities are exploring as public sector finance programs shift eligibility require- ments, reduce grant allocations or simply discontinue operations. Private sector finance may provide funds from instruments including insurance-linked  securities, obtained through insurance policies that cover disaster-related impacts, and  catastrophe bonds that pay premiums after a specific, pre-designated disaster hits the  policy-holder jurisdiction. Social and environmental impact and green bonds are issued  by local governments, for environmental and infrastructure improvements, and provide  tax benefits for the municipality. For example, the Port of Los Angeles issued $35.2  million in green bonds in 2015 for port infrastructure improvements; the City of Los  Angeles has used green bonds to improve municipal water systems. The first set of Opportunity Zones were designated in April 2018, and now all 50 states,  the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories have designated Opportunity Zones.  The program will allow for long-term investments in housing, infrastructure systems,  commercial and economic development in state-designated, frontline communities.  These investments offer a potentially powerful new tool to speed resilience imple- mentation with private investor funds. California will allow state disaster recovery and  climate adaptation funding to leverage private monies in underresourced communities.  Newly introduced federal legislation (SB 3648) will add state wildfire areas to the eligible  community list. The details and legal guidance for these zones is still in development,  but is likely to provide private sector investors tax incentives to spur financing for public  sector infrastructure and community/social investments.  ", "1070": "Philanthropic and Corporate Grants Project teams can establish relationships with community, state, and national grant- makers to further diversify the local capital strategy. Many philanthropies are focusing  more and more on issues of disaster resilience, and the list of resilience strategies can  be cross-referenced with philanthropy priorities to find overlaps. Philanthropic partners  may be well-suited to fund community engagement, training, and non-construction type  projects on the list.  The relationship with private grant making groups is another aspect of the social and  political networks needed to construct a multi-sector finance strategy and requires  steady, intentional, and diplomatic approaches. Finding a good funding match might take  more research and communications as compared with more conventional and previously  established relationships that local jurisdictions might have with public sector program  officers. The most accessible gateway into information on private sector funding is the Funders  Network for Smart Growth and Livable Communities (www.fundersnetwork.org). Many  members of this group are focusing their philanthropy on resilience, and they now have  a Philanthropic Preparedness, Resiliency and Emergency Partnership (PPREP) to build  capacity of community foundations in some states (www.fundersnetwork.org/participate/ pprep/). Other resources include regional community grantmaking alliances and local  community and family foundations.

Local project teams may need to coordinate  with metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), councils of governments (COGs), or  other regional entities with reliable funding. Many MPOs, COGs, or regional planning  agencies may also be the lead agencies for FEMA-approved Local Hazard Mitigation  Plans. Also, many regions have multi-jurisdictional Economic Development Districts that  write Comprehensive Economic Development Strategies or CEDS, which are required to  include regional vulnerabilities and a resilience action plan (www.eda.gov/funding-oppor- tunities/).

While these options vary among the states, California has a long-established  practice of passing statewide bond measures to improve infrastructure, open space,  schools, and housing via grants to local government. The California Strategic Growth  Council, largely funded by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, has allocated billions  annually for resilience implementation and is an example of a state agency program  making inroads on resilience investments. Massachusetts also has dedicated billions  of dollars toward climate adaptation, including through the Municipal Vulnerability  Preparedness (MVP) grant program and with a diverse set of community investment  grants for cities, regions, and other entities.  Information on federal grants is available at grants.gov. This portal posts the announce- ments and all process-related information that jurisdictions, states, and tribal nations  need for applying to these programs. No single resource posts all county, regional, and  state grant programs, and it is difficult to locate them. Identifying county, regional, state,  and federal grant opportunities takes more time to discover, as well as additional staff  work to discern if the funding source will meet local needs. The outcomes of funding  research, though, are worth the staff time and expense.  Regional Resilience Toolkit | Page 85  Step 4. FUND Federal funding for resilience has been enhanced recently. The Disaster Recovery Reform  Act of 2018 will set aside 6% annually of federal disaster expenses to apply to pre-disaster  risk reduction. These monies are a significant boost to previous risk-reduction grants and  are to be used primarily for national infrastructure improvements. Local governments  can actively pursue these funds and be ready to respond to the state-managed appli- cation process that is set to begin in fiscal year 2020", "1075": "What to Measure and Why? Tracking success and evaluating actions are critical elements in ensuring effective imple- mentation of resilience strategies and projects, meeting local needs, securing sound  investments, and ensuring people work together effectively. Identifying what to measure  (metrics), and how to track and evaluate those metrics over time is central to quantifying  results. Good metrics provide:    A baseline that indicates the starting point;    A target for where the community is going;   An indication if there is something wrong; and    Highlights when the agency or city achieves its goal.  Further, well designed metrics can help tell a story for why resilience building is  necessary, attract political support and funding, and focus efforts while providing a  feedback mechanism about whether decisions, investments, and actions to improve resil- ience are making a difference and can help guide future decisions. Good metrics should  be designed to do the following:    Connect to goals, community values, and desired outcomes.    Feasibly track information required to measure the metric. If the data is too difficult or  expensive to track and gather, it does not help.    Mean something and not simply a count. For example, a metric that indicates a  number of people who receive training does not necessarily correlate to knowledge.   Offer fewer, more meaningful metrics rather than a laundry list that will not be  tracked.   Provide data for accountability, guiding action, telling a story, and measuring success.   Be adaptable and scale with the effort and do not become unwieldy.", "1076": "Measure Outputs or Outcomes? Metrics can be designed to measure output (quantitative) and/or an outcome (quali- tative). If the data is available, outputs are relatively easy to track. Examples of outputs  are number of dollars spent or saved, acres of land preserved, or number of staff hired.  However, an output metric does not necessarily demonstrate the quality or success of a  strategy only that something has been done.  An outcome based metric, on the other hand, is more qualitative and tends to measure  the value and effectiveness of a strategy. Examples of outcome metrics could be the  ecological health of preserved land, or community awareness and preparedness for a  disaster.", "1077": "Align with Goals and Strategies Metrics and Resilience Goals, as described in Step 2: Assess, should be linked and  designed to be measured. Using a S.M.A.R.T. goal approach (i.e., a goal that is Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-based) makes the development of an  aligned and useful metric much simpler. Broader goals will require more discussion  about specific and useful metrics and may require multiple, phased metrics (i.e., a  measurement that changes over time) to help measure progress. The hypothetical  examples below illustrate how a goal that is too general makes it challenging to select an  effective metric:  ", "1078": "Considerations when Choosing Metrics  Deciding whether to use metrics and what metrics to use can be overwhelming.

Communities should be deliberate about selecting metrics  systems, and not be afraid to adapt systems to meet their needs.   Useful to decision-makers and stakeholders. Real time, defensible data pointing  to success, or lack of success, can provide information to craft future decisions,  investments, and results. Make sure that the metrics provide data that can be easily  reported and shared regularly.   Versatile and adaptable. Measurement systems can be adapted for an individual  agencys needs and preferences. Metrics with different evaluation methods can  coexist.    Up-to-date and relevant. Consider identifying several measurement periods rather  than a single absolute end to allow for course correction and updates (e.g., quarterly  measurements with annual evaluation). Review and evaluate metrics regularly and  change them if they become irrelevant or obsolete. ", "1079": "Self-Evaluation to Measure  and Refine Self-evaluation, or process evaluation, at the end of a resilience building planning is  different than, but compatible with, establishing metrics. Self-evaluation can require  fewer resources than tracking metrics throughout a whole project and can be done on its  own or in conjunction with metrics systems. Self-evaluation can be an informal process or  a formal outreach and evaluation process.  Use self-evaluation to:   Track overall progress toward goals and identifying major barriers;   Examine the overall effectiveness of a process;    Evaluate the stakeholder engagement process and how it influenced the outcome of  the project;   Identify and solve technical or process challenges such as data acquisition, staffing,  or funding; and   Determine next steps that have emerged from unexpected findings, as a result of  new opportunities, or through changes to decision making.  Self-evaluation can help a community adapt its process to be more effective during future  projects and build more internal knowledge and capacity. Self-evaluation at the end of a  project (or at various stages during the project) is a critical piece that improves the effec- tiveness of investments, staff time, processes, and outcomes.", "1080": "This Toolkit offers an iterative process that is a living and working routine to maintain  and enhance a community or regions resilience over time. The steps, especially Step  1: Engage, need to be pursued consistently to support and ensure successful action.

The lead agency can  evaluate work plans, at a minimum on an annual basis and ideally connected to annual  budgeting, to streamline implementation and administration.", "1081": "There are many reasons to refine the implementation plan or action plan regularly:    The strategies were successfully implemented and new priorities are needed.   Implementation is not achieving the results expected.   The strategy has an unintended consequence.    Funding has changed.   Political will has changed.   New data is available or is clearer.   Other significant changes in the environment or circumstances. When it is time to update the plan, the project team can decide if a full update to the  plan is required, if there is a minor modification needed, or if it is adequate to change the  implementation plan or the annual work plan. Finally, determine the level of community and  stakeholder engagement. The same principles of buy-in and support apply to updates as  in the original plan development. Use the advisory group with stakeholder representatives to ensure successful implemen- tation and lasting impact of the resilience strategies:   Evaluate and measure the progress of the plan.   Connect related and cross-cutting initiatives and actions.   Highlight new ideas and discussions for stakeholders.   Advocate for applying a resilience lens in other activities for the region or city.   Address local, regional, state, and national policy and legislative influences.   Integrate new opportunities into the plan.   Disseminate quantifiable results. This five-step process can be as dynamic as changing demographics, climate conditions,  and community needs.

The six sections are described below.  WHAT ARE NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS? Describes three broad categories of nature-based solutions. Identifies types of nature-based solutions in each category. THE BUSINESS CASE Outlines the many hazards that can be mitigated with nature-based solutions. Discusses the multiple benefits of nature-based solutions, in addition to hazard mitigation. PLANNING AND POLICY-MAKING PHASE  Identifies planning processes and programs that can help users invest in nature-based solutions. Discusses how plans and policies can be updated to allow and encourage nature-based solutions. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE  Reviews how local resources can be mobilized to preserve, restore, and build nature-based solutions. Discusses innovative ways of promoting private investment.

KEY TAKEAWAYS AND RESOURCES  Summarizes key points for communities. Provides additional resources.", "1086": "Green Infrastructure and Low Impact Development Some organizations use the term green infrastructure  to capture the value and functions of natural lands. For  example, the Conservation Fund defines green infrastructure  as a strategically planned and managed network of natural  lands, working landscapes, and other open spaces that  conserves ecosystem values and functions and provides  associated benefits to human populations. Other organizations use the term green infrastructure for  nature-based solutions to urban stormwater pollution. These  organizations emphasize solutions that protect water quality  and aquatic habitat. The other outcomes, such as mitigating  natural hazards, are seen as co-benefits. Low impact  development is another term that is often used to describe  nature-based solutions for urban stormwater. In the field of  stormwater management, green infrastructure and low  impact development are sometimes used interchangeably.", "1087": "Natural Infrastructure The term natural infrastructure is often used to describe  natural or naturalized landscapes that are actively  managed to provide multiple benefits to communities.  The International Institute for Sustainable Development,  a think tank, notes that active management is what sets  natural infrastructure apart from nature. For example,  a managed wetland is a type of natural infrastructure.  Manipulating water levels and cleaning out plant growth  can enhance a managed wetlands water quality, habitat,  and flood storage benefits.  ", "1088": "Engineering with Nature Organizations that design and operate water infrastructure  projects may also refer to Engineering with Nature, a  term that comes from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  (USACE) Engineering with Nature Initiative.

Floodplain restoration rebuilds  some of these natural functions  by reconnecting the floodplain  to its waterway.", "1094": "RAIN GARDENS A rain garden is a shallow, vegetated  basin that collects and absorbs  runoff from rooftops, sidewalks,  and streets. Rain gardens can be added around  homes and businesses to reduce  and treat stormwater runoff.", "1095": "VEGETATED SWALES A vegetated swale is a channel  holding plants or mulch that treats  and absorbs stormwater as it flows  down a slope.  Vegetated swales can be placed along  streets and in parking lots to soak up and  treat their runoff, improving water quality.", "1096": "GREEN ROOFS A green roof is fitted with a planting  medium and vegetation. A green roof  reduces runoff by soaking up rainfall.  It can also reduce energy costs for  cooling the building.

Living shorelines can slow  waves, reduce erosion, and  protect coastal property.", "1106": "Environmental Benefits  Improved water quality: NBS can be used to filter  pollutants from stormwater runoff and to reduce the  volume of polluted water flowing into rivers, lakes,  and coastal waters. In older cities with combined  sewer systems, NBS can also reduce the untreated  sewage going into community waterways. Combined  sewer systems send all stormwater and sewage to  a wastewater treatment plant before releasing the  treated wastewater into waterways. When it rains,  these systems sometimes carry more water than the  treatment plant can handle. As a result, some of the  mixed stormwater and sewage will be released untreated  into waterways. These events are called combined sewer  overflows (CSOs). By lowering the volume of rainwater  flowing into a combined sewer system, NBS can reduce  CSOs and improve water quality. The City of Lenexa, Kansas focuses on  nature-based solutions to prevent stormwater  pollution and reduce stormwater runoff.   Cleaner water supplies: Nature-based solutions that  protect the land around drinking water reservoirs can  keep polluted runoff away from a communitys water  supply. New York City has high-quality tap water because  the city invested in nature-based solutions around its  19 reservoirs. The citys $600 million investment to  conserve and restore the land keeps the water draining  into the reservoirs clean. It provided the same level of  service as the $6 billion water filtration plant that the city  would have needed otherwise.   Improved air quality: Trees, parks, and other plant-based,  nature-based solutions can absorb and filter pollutants  and reduce air temperatures. Doing so reduces smog and  improves air quality.   Healthier wildlife habitats: Watershed and shoreline  nature-based solutions preserve open space and  natural environments. If thoughtfully designed, they  can also connect habitats to give plants and animals  more space to move across the landscape. Both types  of nature-based solutions protect aquatic and wildlife  habitats by improving water quality. Economic Benefits  Increased property values: If a property is near a park  or has more landscaping, it generally has a higher value.  A study of 193 public parks in Portland, Oregon found  that parks had a significant, positive impact on nearby  property values. A park within 1,500 feet of a home  increased its sale price by $1,290 to $3,455 (adjusted  to 2020 dollars). As parks increased in size, their impact  on property value grew.  Improved property tax base: Nature-based solutions  can improve the tax base in both high-growth and  low-growth communities. In high-growth areas,  nature-based features translate into a higher property  tax base. In low-growth communities, nature-based  solutions can stabilize property values in areas with  high vacancies.", "1107": "Green jobs: Green stormwater infrastructure creates  new job opportunities in sectors like landscape  design, paving, and construction. It also opens new  job opportunities in emerging industries.  Los Angeles, California saw an increase of more  than 2,000 jobs from its $166 million investment  in nature-based solutions from 2012-2014. The  best part about this job growth is that many of  these jobs are local, providing an extra boost to  the local economy.  Improved triple bottom line: The triple bottom line is an  accounting framework that measures the value of social  and environmental benefits, as well as financial benefits.  Nature-based solutions provide more triple bottom line  benefits than traditional, gray infrastructure. As a result,  they increases a communitys return on investment. Social Benefits  Added recreational space: Nature-based solutions  that preserve and enhance open space provide more  areas for recreation. In addition, nature-based solutions  such as greenways and green streets can increase  opportunities for active transportation, such as biking  and walking. These spaces can also provide aesthetic  benefits that contribute to improved mental health and  physical well-being.

Since nature-based solutions  provide many different co-benefits, a single project may  be eligible for a variety of private, state, and federal grant  programs. The key to leveraging These resources is to think  outside the box when applying for funding, and to apply to  diverse programs. For example, a coastal community may  seek grant funding for a flood risk reduction project that  uses nature-based approaches. In addition to applying for  hazard mitigation grants, this community could apply for  habitat conservation grants, water quality grants, and coastal  resilience grants. The final section of this guide lists some  of the most common federal grant funding opportunities for  nature-based solutions. Communities should also identify  and leverage the financial assistance available through  state-specific programs. Other potential sources are non-profit  organizations, special districts, and private foundations", "1141": "Building Nature-Based Solutions into the  Capital Improvement Plan The Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) process is another tool  for increasing investments in nature-based solutions. Many  communities use a CIP to plan the timing and financing of  public improvements over the medium term (approximately  five years). Agencies submit projects to be evaluated and  included in the CIP, and the CIP team analyzes and ranks  submitted projects. Ultimately, highly ranked projects  are funded first. Rankings often consider how the project  advances mandated activities and community priorities. They  are also based on whether the project is fiscally responsible.  Including a nature-based component can help increase a  projects ranking, as nature-based solutions may contribute  toward federal Clean Water Act requirements, hazard  mitigation, and other community priorities. It is important to  emphasize the multi-functional nature of these solutions and  how they can provide more bang for the publics buck", "1142": "Funding Nature-Based Solutions with  Stormwater Utility Fees Stormwater utility fee programs are designed to pay for the  cost of managing stormwater runoff. Typically, stormwater  fees are collected in a fund dedicated to the stormwater  management program and stormwater-related projects.  This can be a good, steady source of funding that does  not compete with other community priorities.  Many stormwater utilities are structured to charge users  based on their propertys stormwater runoff volume.  For example, communities can charge a fee based on a  propertys impervious area, rather than its total area. For  this type of fee structure, communities need to have a  good understanding of their impervious cover. Stormwater  utilities are also able to collect fees from all property owners,  including those otherwise exempt from property taxes.

It provides low-interest loans for water infrastructure projects  (including nature-based solutions) that address water quality.  The EPA provides funding to all 50 states and Puerto Rico  to operate CWSRF programs. States provide a 20-percent  match for all federal funds. Since the CWSRF was established,  it has supplied more than $43 billion to state programs.  With that support, states have given $133 billion in loans  to communities.  For most projects, public, private, and non-profit entities  get an average interest rate of 1.4 percent. The loan period  must not exceed 30 years. A key benefit of the programs low  interest rate is that communities may be able to cover debt  service payments without raising the rates for local taxes or  fees.

Local officials can work with private partners to develop and  finance nature-based solutions in many ways. One key step  is to demonstrate the benefits of nature-based solutions  to  make the business case locally. Another is to offer continued  technical assistance and coordination for nature-based  projects. This may include policy support, training, or other  ways to build capacity. Finally, seek long-term agreements  with any private stakeholders that would provide these  services traditionally delivered by the public sector. Above all,  communities should create partnerships with private parties  for specific projects.  ", "1145": "Rebates and Financing Programs Rebates, tax credits, or low-interest loans can encourage  nature-based solutions and practices. For example, Tucson  Water sponsors a Rainwater Harvesting rebate program. It  provides rebates of up to $2,000 to single-family residential  or small commercial customers who install a rainwater  harvesting system. Eligible options include passive rainwater  harvesting, which directs and retains water in the landscape,  and active rainwater harvesting, such as tanks that store  water for later use. Often, participants in this kind of program  need capital at the beginning of a project. Since residents  may not want or be able to fund improvements on their  own, many communities target their rebates and loans at  businesses. Philadelphia, for example, offers low interest  (1 percent) loans for nature-based solutions retrofits on  non-residential property.  Another finance option for promoting nature-based solutions  is the Department of Energy's Property Assessed Clean  Energy (PACE). Communities can use PACE to help property  owners finance nature-based solutions. It also applies to  installing renewable energy or energy-efficient assets on  private properties. Depending on state laws, communities  can create PACE programs by issuing a revenue bond to the  property owner. PACE borrowers can benefit immediately  from new nature-based solutions and repay their debt by  increasing property taxes. For example, increases are at a  set rate for an agreed-upon term, typically 525 years. The  PACE assessment is attached as a tax on the property, not  the property owner. Because PACE is funded through private  loans or municipal bonds, it creates no liability to local  government funds.", "1146": "Grants and Cost-Share Agreements Communities can also encourage nature-based solutions  by directly funding property owners or groups. Onondaga  County, New York has a Green Improvement Fund that  funds nature-based solutions on private commercial and  non-profit properties. Applicants in the target sewer districts  can choose their own nature-based solutions techniques,  but grants are determined by the amount of stormwater  the project captures. The Green Improvement Fund has  awarded 88 grants since 2010, for a total of nearly $11  million. Nature-based solutions projects have included the  installation of porous pavement, added green space, rain  gardens, green roofs, and infiltration projects. Together, the  completed projects can capture more than 38 million gallons  of stormwater runoff per year. Philadelphia manages a similar  voluntary retrofit grant program. It covers the upfront costs  of typical nature-based solutions on private property if the  owner agrees to maintain it.", "1147": "Banking or Credit Trading  Banking or credit trading programs can help developers meet  onsite stormwater retention requirements when nature-based  solutions are not feasible onsite. They create a mechanism  for developers to pay the community to build nature-based  solutions off site. This concept is like that of wetland  mitigation banking. ", "1148": "Environmental Impact Bonds Several traditional debt financing tools are available to  communities. However, environmental impact bonds (EIBs)  are a recent innovation. EIBs can help communities obtain  upfront capital for hard-to-finance environmental projects.  These bonds link project performance incentives to desired  environmental outcomes. In practice, most EIBs function like  traditional bonds, with a fixed interest rate and term. Unlike  normal bonds, they offer investors a performance payment  if projects perform better than expected. The primary benefit  of this model is that it shifts the project performance risk to  a private party and ties borrowing costs to the effectiveness  of a project. If a project underperforms, investors must  reimburse the borrowing entity; if it overperforms, the entity  pays the investors. This model has potential applications for  multiple areas of environmental restoration and resilience,  including nature-based solutions.", "1149": "Development or Redevelopment Incentives Communities can update their land use, zoning, or other  local regulations to provide incentives for using nature-based  solutions. Zoning incentives can allow a greater height,  density, or intensity of development if a developer uses  nature-based approaches. One common zoning incentive  is an increased floor-to-area ratio (FAR), which regulates  the density of development on a site. The City of Portland,  Oregon offers increased FAR as an incentive for installing  green roofs. Communities can also exempt green roofs  or pervious pavements from any regulations that apply to  impervious cover.  More incentives for adopting nature-based solutions  approaches can be used in the development application  and review period. These include discounted application  fees and discounted or waived maintenance bonding  requirements. The City of Chicago, Illinois waives permit fees  for developments that meet specific nature-based solutions  thresholds. For redevelopment, communities can also give a  one-time tax credit for using nature-based approaches that  benefit the public.  More communities are moving from strict standards to  more flexible instruments that include incentives. They are  encouraging developers to use nature-based solutions through  unified development ordinances. They are providing options for  flexibility and creativity during the site plan review process", "1150": "Stormwater Utility Incentives Communities can use a local stormwater utility fee program  to establish a dedicated funding stream for nature-based  solutions. This type of program can offer incentives for  property owners to incorporate nature-based solutions.  For example, a program that charges users based on their  propertys impervious area could offer discounts when  property owners disconnect some of their impervious  area from the storm sewer system by adding nature-based  solutions.

This could apply to  public or private structures as well as critical facilities  and infrastructure. Examples are acquisitions, elevation,  utility undergrounding, and structural retrofits. This  type of action also involves construction of manmade  structures that reduce the impact of hazards, such as  floodwalls, retaining walls, detention and retention  structures, culverts, and safe rooms.

Depending  on State planning enabling legislation, local land use policy  and related development regulations may be required to  conform to comprehensive plan policies. However, even  in situations where such a legal requirement does not  exist, a comprehensive plan can give additional credibility  for implementing mitigation actions. Integrating hazard  mitigation goals into comprehensive plans can elevate the  importance of hazard mitigation throughout the planning  framework. The content of comprehensive plans varies depending on  State or local requirements, as well as the unique needs of  a community, but generally may include some or all of the  following elements:   Community vision and overall goals;   Existing conditions;   Land use;    Transportation;    Housing;    Environmental and natural resources conservation;    Recreation and open space;    Cultural resources;    Historic preservation;    Economic development;    Public facilities and services;    Capital improvements;   Implementation;   Goals, policies, and objectives relating to each plan   element; and   Mapping of existing and future land uses,   infrastructure, public facilities, and environmental   features", "1192": "Consider including hazard identification, risk assessment  information, and hazard mitigation goals in the comprehensive  plan.

Other development regulations may include  subdivision ordinances, design standards, site development  standards such as landscaping standards, overlay zoning, and  critical areas regulations. Floodplain development regulations,  which are required of communities that participate in the  NFIP, would be included in this category as well. These types of regulations provide many effective ways to  address resiliency to known hazards. Zoning, including  overlay zones, can be used to guide development away from  hazard areas, such as by prohibiting development in a landslide  hazard area, or limiting specific uses, such as prohibiting the  placement of hospitals or other essential community facilities  in a floodplain. Subdivision, site development, and critical  areas ordinances can affect the location of development  as well, either through development restrictions such as  prohibiting development immediately adjacent to the urban/ wildland interface, or through flexible permitting provisions  such as planned unit developments, cluster subdivisions, or  8 For more information on Integrating a Health and Safety Element in a  General Plan, go to:  http://www.countyofkings.com/planning/2035%20General%20Plan.html density transfer that allow for intensive use of suitable land  in exchange for the preservation of land more at risk from  hazards.", "1196": "Capital Improvement and Infrastructure Programs Capital Improvement Programs (CIPs) and other  infrastructure-related programs such as Transportation  Improvement Programs (TIPs) establish spending priorities,  typically over a five or six year period. CIPs and TIPs identify  specific projects and target funds to complete the projects  on the list. Such programs typically include important public  improvements such as wastewater treatment plants, water  and sewer lines, fire stations, or roadway expansions. Many of  these improvements are critical facilities that are vital to the  functioning of a community and warrant careful attention  to hazard risks. The placement and design of such facilities  should ensure their continued functioning in the event of a  disaster.  CIPs often fund structural mitigation measures, including  stormwater drainage improvements or retrofitting public  facilities and infrastructure to better withstand the forces of  nature. The CIP may be the main implementation vehicle for  such projects. It is important; therefore, to ensure that major  structural mitigation projects that are identified in your  hazard mitigation plan become part of your CIP. Capital improvements can also profoundly affect how and  where a community grows. Constructing a major sewer  trunk line or a highway interchange can open up previously  undeveloped areas to growth. Communities should be  strategic about such improvements and consider whether  public investments may encourage growth in high risk areas.", "1197": "Area Plans Area, subarea, district, neighborhood, corridor, or similar  plans that focus on a defined area within a community provide  excellent opportunities to integrate hazard mitigation in a  targeted way. For example, a waterfront district plan may be  subject to flooding or wind and wave hazards associated with  the water feature. Identifying and recognizing the hazard can  help form the foundation for the district plan and guide its  policies. Structural measures or wetland preservation may be  proposed and possible locations mapped in the plan", "1198": "Stormwater Management Plans A stormwater management plan identifies the  contribution that stormwater infrastructure makes to  a flood hazard and identifies policies or improvements  that can be made to mitigate the hazard.

Open space is often an  appropriate use of hazard areas and can be used to  buffer developed areas from hazards.", "1201": "Transportation Plans Transportation plans establish priorities for major  transportation improvements, including mass transit.  Transportation plans may also contain standards, such  as street cross sections. The transportation plan may  consider hazards when identifying potential new  transportation corridors, both to avoid hazards and to  avoid inducing new development in high hazard areas", "1202": "Economic Development Plans In this type of functional plan, methods and goals  to guide private investment to areas that are less  vulnerable to known hazards encourage mutual  public and private objectives focused on protecting,  sustaining, and enhancing the communitys economic  base. Such opportunities may also include structural  or other protective measures of commercial areas,  business continuity planning, or activities that promote  a diverse economic base that is not overly reliant on  businesses or industries that are particularly vulnerable  to the impacts of disasters. Economic development  plans can also highlight the rationale for infrastructure  projects that prevent impacts or disruption to the  business community and support long-term economic  stability.", "1203": "Emergency Operations Plans Local emergency operations plans (EOPs) describe  what the local government will do when conducting  emergency operations. These functions focus on  actions, such as direction and control, warning, public  notification, and evacuation, that the local government  will take during the initial phase of response  operations.

The purpose of such a plan is  to make advance planning decisions and formalize  a process to guide long-term recovery and  redevelopment after a disaster. This type of planning  goes beyond the operations and disaster response  procedures typically captured in an emergency  management plan. Long-term recovery planning  considers housing or business area reconstruction  or economic redevelopment over a timeline of five  or more years. It is important to consider long-term  recovery prior to a disaster because the pressure to  rebuild quickly after a disaster can often lead to short- term decisions with long-term effects that compromise  the overall resilience of a community. A post-disaster  recovery and reconstruction plan can identify roles  and responsibilities of key people, departments, and  agencies; address the need for temporary regulations  such as post-disaster building moratoria; potential  impacts to historic resources; potential impacts to non- conforming uses; and location and other provisions for  temporary housing. The plan may also seek to integrate  long-term hazard mitigation goals.10", "1205": "Potential Funding Tools A variety of special programs may provide opportunities to  meet community goals for resiliency. Transfer of Development  Rights (TDR) programs are used for farmland, natural area,  or open space preservation. A TDR works by identifying a  sending area, which is the area targeted for preservation,  and a receiving area, which is an area appropriate for  more intensive development. The development rights of the  sending area can then be sold or transferred to properties in  the receiving area. Such a program can provide an effective  incentive to steer development away from high hazard areas.  Other programs may include Tax Increment Financing (TIF)  local improvement or business improvement districts. For  example a local improvement district could levy a special  tax on an area to generate funds to provide public hazard  protection measures in that area, such as an impact fee. A  TIF program could be used as an incentive for development  in an area targeted for safe growth, potentially offsetting the  pressure to develop in high hazard areas", "1206": "Site Plan (Project) Review Site plan or project permit review and approval criteria may  include specific standards for evaluating risks and requiring  safe growth best practices. Such criteria can be codified  using the zoning and municipal code controls discussed  above. The effectiveness of such criteria can be reinforced by  providing guidance to project applicants, such as checklists or  handouts. Subdivision or site plan reviews provide excellent  opportunities to proactively address hazard mitigation in  new construction. Neighborhood design and site planning in your community  may be built around smart growth principles. Smart growth  and hazard mitigation are not mutually exclusive and  thoughtful planning can incorporate both. For example,  among the basic Smart Growth Principles,12 taking advantage  of compact building design and preserving open space,  farmland, natural beauty, and critical environmental areas are  effective methods to protect new development or redeveloped  areas from the impacts of natural hazards.", "1207": "Building Codes Codes provide minimum safeguards for people with regard  to building safety and fire prevention. Codes protect health,  safety, and welfare as they relate to the residential and  commercial built environment. Standard building codes,  such as the one developed by the International Code Council  (ICC),13 typically serve as the recommended or state adopted  model for what a community adopts as its own local codes.  These codes are only a minimum and higher standard codes  would greatly improve the resilience of a community. When  a hazard profile is done in the mitigation plan, the building  codes can be reviewed to see if they sufficiently meet the  standards needed to adequately protect lives and property  from the forces of known hazards", "1208": "fe Growth Audit Performing a Safe Growth Audit16 is a way to assess how  well your existing planning tools address hazard risks and  community resiliency.

A more detailed description of how to use this Safe Growth  Audit can be found in the Hazard Mitigation: Integrating Best  Practices into Planning17 report published by the American  Planning Association. As contributing author David Godschalk  summarizes in a related article: Conducting a Safe Growth Audit can help to prevent  future growth conflicts. If the community and its elected  officials understand how their zoning and subdivision  ordinances allow growth in hazardous areas, they  can revise these ordinances before property owners  embark on risky projects. If they understand how  their comprehensive plans fail to guide growth to safe  locations, they can amend the plans. If they understand  how their capital improvement programs encourage  unsafe growth, they can change their utility provision  policies.18 This statement raises the important point that leadership,  staff, and stakeholders be engaged in your Safe Growth Audit  and in integrating hazard mitigation into the community  planning frameworkwhich leads us into Step 2 of your  integration effort.", "1209": "Step 2: Inform and Engage Local Leadership, Staff,  and Stakeholders The importance of identifying, informing, and engaging  multiple stakeholders should not be lost on community  planners.

The value of this role with  regard to community resilience cannot be overstated. By  their nature, disasters affect the whole community and  require integrated solutions.

The purpose of mitigation planning is to  identify local policies and actions that can be implemented  over the long term to reduce risk and future losses from  hazards. These mitigation policies and actions are identified  based on an assessment of hazards, vulnerabilities, and risks and  the participation of a wide range of stakeholders and the public  in the planning process. Benefits of mitigation planning include:  Identifying actions for risk reduction that are agreed upon  by stakeholders and the public.  Focusing resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities.

Task 1 describes how to determine the planning area and the participating  jurisdictions, as well as who will lead the plan and the resources needed to support the planning process. Your  community can develop its own single jurisdiction plan or work with neighboring jurisdictions on a multi- jurisdictional plan.  Establish the Planning Area The planning area refers to the geographic area covered by the plan. Generally, the planning area follows local  government1  jurisdictional boundaries, such as cities, townships, counties, or planning districts. However, planning  areas also may be defined by watersheds or other natural features, particularly where hazards create similar risks  across jurisdictional boundaries. A jurisdictions boundaries may also cross over or encompass other jurisdictions,  such as a fire protection district or a utility district.  The State Hazard Mitigation Officer (SHMO)2  or State emergency management agency can help communities  determine the appropriate planning area. This determination may be based on State planning goals and planning  grant funding priorities.  Mitigation Plan Updates  If you are updating your communitys plan, determine if the planning area defined in the previously approved  plan is still appropriate. Review any lessons learned in the previous planning process. Consider whether your  communitys mitigation planning needs were met by the previous planning effort or whether your community  would benefit from adjusting the planning area and the participating jurisdictions.  ", "1245": "You may look to partner with neighboring jurisdictions  and quasi-governmental agencies, such as school districts,  transportation authorities, and utility or service districts.  Special districts have a vested interest in reducing threat and  hazard impacts, particularly if they provide services critical  to recovery efforts.

It is  also helpful to include a map showing the jurisdictional boundaries of the planning area.", "1247": "Leading the Planning Process Whether your community is developing a single jurisdiction plan or is participating in a multi-jurisdictional  planning process, strong leadership is needed throughout the planning process. Assigning the agency or individual  that will lead the mitigation planning effort is an important initial decision. Many local agencies have interest and responsibility in mitigation and should be included in the planning process.  For example, both the emergency management and community planning and development staff in local government  have unique knowledge and experience to make them natural leaders for a mitigation planning process. Local  emergency management staff has an understanding of local threats and hazards, risks, and consequences and may  have more experience working with State and Federal agencies on mitigation projects and activities. Community  planning staff is familiar with zoning and subdivision regulations, land use plans, economic development initiatives,  and long-term funding and planning mechanisms to implement mitigation strategies, and they may be trained to  facilitate public outreach, conduct meetings, and develop a plan document.  Both community development and emergency management departments, among others, are capable of providing  leadership in the development of a local hazard mitigation plan. When determining leadership, consider who has  the time and resources to commit to the entire planning process. In addition, in multi-jurisdictional plans, each  participating jurisdiction identifies a lead representative to coordinate their communitys planning process.

Be aware of the available resourceshuman, technical, and financial that your jurisdiction has to complete this planning effort. Combining resources with other jurisdictions through a  multi-jurisdictional planning effort as described previously may save time and money, or may leverage subject matter  expertise. Alternatively, specific parts of the planning process or plan preparation may require technical assistance.  If outside technical assistance is needed to help develop the plan, consider how to leverage this assistance to build  long-term community capabilities.  Although developing a hazard mitigation plan does not require formal training in community planning,  engineering, or science, it may be helpful to get outside expertise in some areas. For instance, you could seek  assistance with:  Identifying hazards, assessing vulnerabilities, and understanding significant risks.  Facilitating planning team meetings, public involvement, and decision making activities.  Creating an organized and functional plan document, including maps or other graphics. There are several different options when considering outside assistance for plan development. Consider contracting  with your regional planning agency or working with a local university with planning or emergency management  degree programs. You may also contact another community that has already completed the planning process for  suggestions. Before enlisting outside assistance from any of these sources, consider the scope of work, the extent of 1-4 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 1 Determine the Planning Area and Resources assistance required, and the level of interaction between the consulting service providers and other members of the  planning team.  Private consultants are an additional resource available to assist in the coordination, facilitation, and execution of  the mitigation planning process. If your community decides to hire a consultant, consider looking for a professional  community planner who:  Recognizes the unique demographic, geographic, technical, and political considerations of each participating  community.  Demonstrates knowledge or experience with land use and community development.  Understands all the applicable policies and regulations as they apply to the mitigation plan, including Federal  law, FEMA guidance, and state and local ordinances.  Recognizes that community input and public participation are integral to any successful mitigation plan.  Exhibits familiarity with emergency management and multi-hazard mitigation concepts.  Provides past performance information and references.", "1249": "Conclusion Determining the planning area and overall scope of the planning project is up to your community. Building on  existing planning efforts or working with other jurisdictions are common approaches to defining the planning area.  Identifying the plans local lead and the need for outside technical assistance are important first steps in organizing  your resources. Whether a single or multi-jurisdictional plan, all jurisdictions share the same commitment to  developing a plan to reduce risks from hazards in their communities. Task 2 describes how to form a planning team  to guide the planning process.", "1250": "Identify Planning Team Members When building the planning team, start with existing community organizations or committees if  possible. For mitigation plan updates, reconvene the team from the previous planning process along  with any additional individuals or organizations. A committee that oversees the comprehensive plan or  addresses issues related to land use, transportation, or public facilities can be a good foundation for your  mitigation planning team. You may consider how threats and hazards impact economic development, housing,  health and social services, infrastructure, or natural and cultural resources to determine what agencies and offices  to include. You could also build on your communitys existing Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). 1 This group deals with hazardous materials safety and may  also address other threats and natural hazards issues. In small  communities, LEPCs may be comprised of the same people and  organizations that are needed for the mitigation planning team.  Representatives from agencies involved in hazard mitigation  activities, agencies with the authority to regulate development,  and offices responsible for enforcing local ordinances are  important members of the planning team. These agencies are  likely to be assigned responsibility and have the expertise for  implementing mitigation actions. Examples of partner agencies  are listed in the sidebar. Appendix A also includes a checklist of  potential agencies and organizations to consider when you are  building the planning team (see Worksheet 2.1).  It is important to distinguish between those who should serve  as members of the planning team and other stakeholders.  Stakeholders are individuals or groups that are affected by a  mitigation action or policy and include businesses, private  organizations, and citizens. Unlike planning team members,  stakeholders may not be involved in all stages of the planning  process, but they inform the planning team on a specific  topic or provide input from different points of view in the  community.

Leadership from elected officials  with an interest in improving safety and disaster resiliency ensures  the planning process has visibility and encourages stakeholder participation.  Equally important is the role of a strong advocate or local champion for mitigation on the planning team, who  helps enlist the support and participation of local officials and community leaders and leads the hazard mitigation  planning effort. If one has not already been established, the planning team may select a leader, or chairperson, to  oversee and help manage the planning process. This person does not need to be a professional planner or expert in  hazard mitigation, but must be able to communicate the purpose and importance of the mitigation plan, convene  the planning team, and facilitate the completion of tasks required for the mitigation plan to be finished on schedule.  ", "1254": "Promote Participation and Buy-In Identifying potential planning team members may be fairly straightforward; however, persuading individuals with  competing priorities to invest time and energy in the mitigation planning process can be challenging.  It is important to determine what planning team members are expected to contribute, as well as how they will be  invited to participate. While updating a plan, you should consider what worked well or did not during the previous  planning process. The following are approaches for recruiting potential team members that have worked for  communities in the past:  After sending an email or letter invitation, follow it up with a phone call to emphasize why participation is  needed and to answer any questions.  Send a formal invitation signed by the mayor, elected official, or department head.   Plan the initial meeting at a convenient time and location for everyone.  Provide beverages or food at meetings to bolster attendance and attention spans.", "1255": "he people invited to participate want to know what is expected of their participation and why their presence is  important. The purpose and importance of various contributors includes the following:  Local community planners can help the planning team understand past, current, and future community  development trends, the policies or activities that affect development, and the relationship between hazards and  development.  Emergency managers are first responders to disasters, have information on past occurrences and existing  preparedness measures, and have a direct line of communication with the State emergency management agency.  Element A2 The planning process shall include  an opportunity for neighboring  communities, local and regional  agencies involved in hazard mitigation  activities, and agencies that have the  authority to regulate development, as  well as businesses, academia and  other private and non-profit interests  to be involved in the planning  process. 44 CFR 201.6(b)(2)2-3 Task 2 Build the Planning Team  GIS specialists can analyze and map data to support the planning process and communicate complex  information, such as the locations of assets at risk in threat- or hazard-prone areas and estimates of damage for a  particular disaster scenario.   Public works/engineering staff can help identify current or projected problems for the communitys  infrastructure that can be addressed through capital improvements supported by the mitigation plan.  Elected and executive officials are mindful of the community as a whole and communicate how the mitigation  plan can support other social, economic, or environmental goals for the community.   Floodplain administrators provide information on your communitys flood hazard maps, floodplain ordinance,  repetitive loss properties, and actions to continue compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program and  reduce flood losses.   State and Federal partners provide available data, understand how to identify and leverage resources across  agencies, and can identify state and Federal programs with complementary missions. Planning efforts can be more successful if the team is designated with some official authority to develop the  mitigation plan. Therefore, the planning team can obtain official recognition in the form of a council resolution or a  Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). This demonstrates community support, increases commitment to the process,  and improves the likelihood that mitigation actions identified in the plan will be implemented successfully. An  example MOA for a multi-jurisdictional planning team is included in Appendix A (see Worksheet 1.2).", "1256": ". Confirm plan purpose  The planning team may start by agreeing on  the overall purpose of the planning process  and the outcome that the community seeks to  accomplish as the plan is implemented. Some  communities develop a mission statement  that drives the process and describes in a  short, simple statement the intended outcome.  This helps unite the planning team around a  common purpose and provides a foundation for  the rest of the planning process. This also helps  Multi-Jurisdiction Planning Team  The Multi-jurisdictional Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan for Monmouth County, New Jersey included 53 municipalities that  required an organizational structure to facilitate inter- and intra-governmental coordination. The overall Planning Committee  was divided into one Core Planning Group and 53 separate Jurisdictional Assessment Teamsone for each participating  jurisdiction.  Core Planning Group  The Core Planning Group (CPG) was made up of County Steering Committee members and leaders from each Jurisdictional  Assessment Team. CPG members were typically representatives of their local emergency management, engineering,  planning, GIS, administration, public works, building, or highway departments. The CPG managed the overall plan activities  and directly contributed to the decision making process.  Jurisdictional Assessment Teams  The Jurisdictional Assessment Teams (JAT) were headed by a Team Leader who served and represented their interests on  the CPG. JATs included broader representation from within the individual jurisdictions, and many chose to align their JAT  with an existing Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The JATs were responsible for local community involvement  and were required to:  Coordinate and facilitate local efforts.  Attend meetings.  Provide information and feedback.  Involve the public and community stakeholders in the planning process.  Assess mitigation alternatives.  Select a course of action to be followed for their communities.   Adopt the plan.  Implement the plan and monitor its progress. This organizational structure was successfully implemented for the Countys initial plan development and is maintained for  plan updates.

Through partnerships and careful planning, identify and reduce  the vulnerability to natural hazards in order to protect the health,  safety, quality of life, environment, and economy of the communities  within Somerset County (Somerset County, New Jersey All Hazards  Mitigation Plan).2-5 Task 2 Build the Planning Team to communicate the reason for the plan to stakeholders, elected officials, and the public. If you received a mitigation  planning grant from FEMA, the grant may include language regarding the overall purpose of the plan that could be  incorporated. The plans scope of work often includes more information on the background and objectives of the  planning project, as well. 2. Review the current mitigation plan If updating your mitigation plan, a general review of your communitys previously approved plan can  provide a good starting point for identifying ideas for improvement and areas that may require more time  and resources. This can impact the plans scope and schedule. 3. Refine plan scope and schedule The kickoff meeting is a good time for the planning team to agree upon the overall scope of work and schedule  for developing or updating the mitigation plan and review the requirements of a hazard mitigation plan for FEMA  approval. If you received a grant to develop the plan, the scope of work and schedule may already be developed, or  the grant may serve as the starting point for a more detailed work plan. It is important that everyone walks away  from the kickoff meeting with an understanding of the overall project purpose, schedule, and tasks, as well as the  agendas and goals for future planning team meetings. The remaining tasks in this Handbook can help you to establish  a schedule and agenda items for future meetings. A sample schedule is also available in Appendix A (see Worksheet  2.2). 4. Establish responsibilities The planning team can establish roles and  responsibilities at the beginning of the planning  process. The planning team members should  have a clear understanding of their roles and  responsibilities, as well as how much time  they may need to dedicate to the project. This  can help you to identify any potential gaps or  shortfalls in resources needed to complete the  mitigation plan early in the planning process.", "1257": "5. Develop an outreach strategy One critical task of the planning team is  determining who else needs to be involved in  the mitigation planning process and how. An  outreach strategy identifies the stakeholder groups that are important to involve in the process and how to engage  them. The planning team also develops ideas for how to involve the general public in the planning process. Task 3   Create an Outreach Strategy describes how to develop a comprehensive approach to engaging stakeholders and the public  in the mitigation planning process.  ", "1258": "Documentation of the Planning Process  Planning Team  The plan document is the written record of the planning  process and must describe how the plan was prepared for  each jurisdiction including the schedule and activities that  made up the plans development, as well as who was involved  in the process. The plan can also document how the planning  team members were selected and what each team member  contributed to the planning effort.  Multi-jurisdictional plans must identify who represented each  jurisdiction, including the persons position or title and agency,  at a minimum. Since the plan is intended to provide a resource  for the community, the planning process provides enough detail  to allow those updating the plan to identify and coordinate with those agencies that were involved in the process.  Plan updates must include documentation of the current planning process undertaken to update the plan.", "1259": "Conclusion Task 2 describes how to identify and engage a planning team, including planning teams that represent multiple  jurisdictions. The planning process is as important as the plan itself, and the planning team helps shape and guide  that process. Task 3 describes how the planning team can involve other stakeholders and the public.  ", "1260": "Task 3  Create an Outreach Strategy A key element in the mitigation planning process is the discussion it promotes among community members about  creating a safer, more disaster-resilient community. A plan that accurately reflects the communitys values and  priorities is likely to have greater legitimacy and buy-in and greater success in implementing mitigation actions  and projects to reduce risk. Federal regulation for mitigation plan approval requires that stakeholders and the general public are given  opportunities to be involved during the planning process and in the plans maintenance and implementation.  Community members can therefore provide input that can affect the content and outcomes of the mitigation plan.  Task 3 builds on the idea of an outreach strategy introduced in Task 2  Build the Planning Team. An outreach strategy  identifies what you want to accomplish through your outreach  efforts, who to involve in the process, and how and when to  ", "1261": "Stakeholders A stakeholder is any person, group, or institution that can affect  or be affected by a course of action. Involving stakeholders in the  planning process helps to develop support for the plan and identify  barriers to implementation. In addition, mitigation planning  incorporates information from scientific and technical sources and  subject matter experts.  At a minimum, the stakeholders that must be included in the  planning process are neighboring communities, local and  regional agencies involved in hazard mitigation activities, and  agencies that have the authority to regulate development, as well  as businesses, academia, and other private and nonprofit interests.  Task 2 discussed the importance of involving local and regional  agencies involved in hazard mitigation activities and agencies  that have the authority to regulate development on the planning  team. Unlike planning team members, stakeholders need not be  involved in all stages of the planning process, but may inform the  planning team on a specific topic or provide input from different  points of view in the community.  ", "1262": "You must also invite stakeholder participation from neighboring  communities that are not part of the planning area and  participating jurisdictions. These may be adjacent counties  and municipalities, such as those that are affected by similar  threat or hazard events or may be partners in mitigation and  response activities. For example, you could involve neighboring  communities in the planning process by issuing an invitational  email or letter to the emergency managers or local officials of  the adjacent counties inviting their participation in outreach  activities and their input on the draft mitigation plan.", "1263": " Elected officials and planning commission members. Elected officials have the responsibility to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their constituents and  typically are the governing bodies that adopt the plan prior to FEMA approval. The level of support that the  elected officials provide to the mitigation plans goals and actions largely determines the plans progress and  implementation, and ultimately, the resilience of the  community.", "1264": " Business leaders and large employers. Economic resiliency  drives a communitys recovery after a disaster. A key  component of mitigation planning is identifying those  economic assets and drivers whose losses and inability  to operate would severely impact the community and  its ability to recover from a disaster. Involving economic  development officials, the local chamber of commerce, and  business leaders in the planning process and educating them  about local risks and vulnerabilities can make them partners  in future mitigation initiatives. More information on  determining your communitys economic assets is included  in Task 5  Conduct a Risk Assessment.", "1265": " Regional, State, and Federal agencies. Public agencies, such  as regional planning agencies, geological surveys, forestry  divisions, emergency management offices, dam safety agencies, and weather service offices, at the regional,  State, and Federal government levels are key resources for data and technical information, as well as financial  assistance. These agencies may have programs that complement your mitigation planning goals.", "1266": " Cultural institutions. Cultural institutions, such as museums, libraries, and theatres, often have unique  mitigation needs. For example, they may be located in a historic building or house collections that require  special protection from natural hazards. These institutions also may keep records and collections of historic  information on natural disasters in your community, particularly floods, fires, and earthquakes. For more  information, see Integrating Historic Property and Cultural Resource Considerations into Hazard Mitigation Planning (FEMA  386-6).", "1267": " Colleges and universities. Like public agencies, academic institutions have valuable resources to assist with the  planning efforts, such as natural hazards data, GIS mapping and analysis, or research on successful methods to  reduce risk. The planning team may be able to collaborate with a local college or university to engage students in  1 http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1892 Successful Outreach   Informs and educates about hazards and  risks  Invites interested parties to contribute their  views and ideas for mitigation  Identifies conflicts and incorporates different  perspectives and priorities early in the  process  Provides data and information that improves  overall quality and accuracy of the plan  Ensures transparency and builds trust  Maximizes opportunities for implementation  through greater consensus and acceptance Professional designers, urban planners,  architects, and community members participate  in an outreach and information meeting.3-3 Task 3 Create an Outreach Strategy the planning process or to complete research and analysis needed for the mitigation plan. Consider partnering  with the urban planning, geology, emergency management, geography, or environmental studies departments.  Participating in the mitigation planning process can also help local colleges and universities understand and  reduce threat and hazard risks on their campuses.", "1268": " Nonprofit organizations. These groups often act as advocates for citizens and can be important in public  outreach, information sharing, and getting support for the mitigation actions developed in the plan. Nonprofit  organizations might include disaster preparedness and  response organizations, such as the local Red Cross;  parks, recreation, or conservation organizations; historic  preservation groups; church organizations; and parent- teacher organizations.", "1269": " Neighborhood groups. Many communities have existing  neighborhood associations and homeowners associations  that are active and engaged in community activities. These  groups can provide valuable information about local risks  and possible mitigation solutions in specific areas. They can  also help with dissemination of information via newsletters  and periodic meetings. Also, consider contacting people  involved in Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT),  since they are knowledgeable about threats and hazards, and  they are interested in making the community more disaster  resilient.", "1270": "Public The general public must also be given an opportunity to be  involved in the planning process. More than just informing the  public of the plans development, a good public outreach effort  educates the public and motivates them to take action. Many  mitigation actions affect private property; therefore, the public  should be engaged early to understand community priorities. In  addition, although members of the public may not be technical  experts, they can help identify community assets and problem  areas, describe issues of concern, narrate threat and hazard  history, prioritize proposed mitigation alternatives, and provide  ideas for continuing public involvement after plan adoption.", "1271": "How to Develop Your Outreach Strategy The public relations or public information official (PIO), if available in your community, provides valuable services  by helping to generate messages, work with the media, and coordinate public information sharing throughout the  Group exercise designed to help citizens express  needs for reducing hazard risks in their  community. Element A3 The planning process shall include an  opportunity for the public to comment  on the plan during the drafting stage  and prior to plan approval. 44 CFR 201.6(b)(1)3-4 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 3 Create an Outreach Strategy mitigation planning process. With or without a designated PIO, the planning team can develop an effective outreach  strategy through the following steps: 1. Brainstorm outreach activities The planning team can conduct a brainstorming session to identify stakeholders during the project kickoff  meeting, as well as to determine when and how to conduct outreach activities. If completing a plan  update, the planning team should evaluate the stakeholders and the outreach activities involved in the  previous planning process and identify any necessary changes. 2. Determine public outreach objectives and schedule  What input do you need from stakeholders? What input do you want from the public? How can stakeholders and  the public contribute to the development of the capability review, risk assessment, and mitigation strategy? These  questions can help determine the objectives of your outreach strategy. As the project kicked off, the planning team  confirmed a schedule of tasks and meetings for completing the plan or plan update. Revisit this schedule and  identify the times when it is important to inform and seek input from stakeholders and the public. For example,  a good time to invite public involvement is after the risk assessment is complete and the planning team begins to  create the mitigation strategy. Involving the public at this stage provides the opportunity to educate them on the  risk assessment findings, collect input on any data inaccuracies, and understand their ideas and priorities for various  mitigation actions.  3. Identify appropriate outreach methods  What are the best methods for reaching out to stakeholders and the public? This may be driven by planning needs,  schedule, and budget as defined by the planning team. Stakeholders should be engaged using targeted methods  for specific input. Online surveys, one-on-one briefings, phone interviews, roundtable discussions, presentations  to specific groups, and personal invitations to public outreach activities are all potential methods to involve  stakeholders. If your community has recently been affected by a disaster event, the public may have a heightened interest in  hazards and mitigation. Use this interest to get community members engaged in finding ways to avoid the impacts  of future events. A public meeting that primarily focuses on hazard mitigation may not be well attended, if the  community has not recently been affected by hazard events. Use the planning team to help identify what methods  of public involvement have previously worked well in your community. It helps to reach out to people instead  of asking them to come to you. For example, setting up a booth at a popular community event or getting on the  agenda of a scheduled meeting could reach a greater number of people than a meeting that solely discusses hazard  mitigation.  A variety of informational materials and methods, such as news media, social media, fliers, surveys, and websites,  are useful for reaching out to the public during the planning process. Consider messages for Twitter and content for  sharing on Facebook. Public involvement activities should include methods designed to improve public awareness  by presenting information (one-way communication), as well as to solicit input to inform the plans content  (two-way communication).  As with all public outreach materials and activities, ensure equal access and meaningful participation of all  individuals with access and functional needs, including individuals from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds,  with and without limited English proficiency, seniors, children, and members of underserved populations.  Table 3.1 provides examples of how communities have successfully used different types of outreach methods in  mitigation planning. 3-5 Task 3 Create an Outreach Strategy Table 3.1: Example Outreach Methods in Mitigation Planning Outreach Method Community Example Community  Events At the annual fair in Howard County, Maryland, the Office of Emergency Management has a booth to educate  residents on preparing for natural hazards. Brochures and fliers on related topics are distributed to visitors. Interviews The focus of the hazard mitigation planning process for Oakland County, Michigan was a series of structured  discussions with County officials, municipal officials, affected stakeholders, and the general public. This broad  outreach effort included telephone and face-to-face interviews with leaders and representatives from each of the  Countys 62 communities, 28 public schools districts, and 2 public universities to identify hazards of concern  and potential mitigation measures. News Media The mitigation planning process in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina included extensive outreach to local  media outlets. In response, the local television, radio and print media partners prepared stories to help promote  widespread public involvement. Through the City of Charlottes Corporate Communications & Marketing Office,  e-blasts soliciting input on draft plan documents as well as public meeting attendance were sent out using  distribution lists that included government agencies, businesses, and civic organizations. Public meeting  information was sent to all City and County employees, posted to the communitys online public events calendar,  added to live tickers that scrolled across the bottom of the local government access television channel, and  shared through C-Mail (bi-weekly e-newsletter for City of Charlotte news and events). In addition, live television  coverage of public input meetings was provided with the ability for citizens to submit their questions or  comments by e-mail. Presentations  to Governing  Bodies During the development of a Multi-jurisdictional Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan for Garfield County, Colorado  the Steering Committee made several presentations to the Board of County Commissioners about the status of  the plan. These meetings were public and announcement of the plan agenda item was included along with the  announcement of the public meeting. Questionnaires/ Surveys In completing its first hazard mitigation plan, Catawba County, North Carolina used a survey to capture  information from people who might not have been able to attend the public meetings or participate through  other means in the mitigation planning process. Copies of the survey were distributed by local officials and  made available for residents to complete at local county and municipal offices, and an electronic version was  posted on their websites. Nearly 250 respondents to the survey provided input for the Countys planning team to  consider in developing their mitigation strategy. Roundtables/ Forums  In order to solicit ideas from citizens on how to reduce the risk of natural hazards, the City of Everett, Washington  sponsored a public forum titled the Safe and Sound Summit: Help Everett Master Disaster. Attended by more  than 80 residents of the community, this was the primary public event designed to both educate the public and  to empower citizens to contribute to the hazard mitigation plans action items. The meeting format was adapted  from The World Caf method, a conversational process designed to bring people together to discuss questions  that matter through small group discussions that rotated between tables on different topics. The resulting ideas  helped the Citys planning team to identify risks, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities in Everett. Social Media Clark County, Kansas (population 1,950) used computer technology to obtain public input by creating the Clark  County, Kansas Hazard Mitigation Plan Facebook page. They included small video clips with community leaders  talking about the importance of mitigation planning. Additionally, the Facebook page was used to hold a drawing  for an Apple iPod Shuffle 2GB MP3 Player posting that all those that participate and provide feedback via this  Facebook page will be entered in the drawing. Area-specific  Meetings The City of Tulsa, Oklahoma holds small, area-specific meetings on a semi-annual basis at public libraries and  other public venues. These meetings are used to distribute literature and educate citizens on actions they can  take to mitigate natural hazards, save lives, and prevent property damage. Input also is solicited about how the  mitigation process can be more effective. Website Pinal County, Arizona used their website to promote the mitigation plan by providing a definition of hazard  mitigation planning, a list of who is involved in the local planning process, a description of how the plan update  process works, and information about upcoming stakeholder meetings and opportunities for public involvement.  Point of contact information was also provided for questions or comments. Downloads available from the site  include copies of the existing plan, the plan update, public notices, and press releases.3-6 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 3 Create an Outreach Strategy 4. Develop clear and consistent messages that align with community values Consider the overarching goals and values of the community and how they align with reducing the impacts of  future hazards and disasters. Then, personalize talking points for discussions with different audiences and develop  messages that appeal to them. For example, if a gold-medal trout stream or historic downtown is important to a  communitys identity and economy, then frame mitigation messages to emphasize these assets and the need for their  long-term protection.  5. Evaluate and incorporate feedback from outreach activities The feedback you receive through outreach activities, such as completed questionnaires and surveys, comments at  meetings, and comments on plan drafts, should be evaluated and incorporated into the planning teams decision  making process and the final plan. During the outreach process, clearly communicate to stakeholders and the public  how the planning team uses their feedback to inform the plan. Develop a process for organizing and evaluating the  comments received, as well as documenting them in the final plan. 6. Provide an opportunity for public review of the final draft plan The public must be given the opportunity to review and comment  on the final draft plan prior to its adoption. This may be done by  providing copies of the draft plan in the local library, city hall,  or community center, as well as posting it on the communitys  website. Consider allowing at least four weeks for review and  comment and providing some guidance on the type of comments  and feedback that you are seeking. For instance, it is helpful to  get feedback from the public on the identification of community  assets and the prioritization of the mitigation actions in the plan.  Inform the public through a press release in the local newspaper  and on the communitys website when a draft is available for review and how they may provide comment. Some  jurisdictions have policies in place for the public review of documents prior to adoption, which should be followed  for the final comment period for the mitigation plan.", "1272": "Continuing Public Outreach over Time The outreach strategy should address both the planning process and how to keep people engaged after the plans  adoption. Ongoing outreach continues the discussion with the community about hazards and risks, builds support  for implementation of mitigation activities, and informs the outreach strategy for the next plan update process.  The plan must describe how the jurisdictions will continue  public participation during the plans implementation and  maintenance.  The outreach activities conducted during the planning process, as  described above, are a good source of ideas for how to continue  to involve stakeholders and the public during plan maintenance  and implementation. Consider repeating successful outreach  events annually. Other examples of activities for continued  public participation include periodic presentations on the plans  progress to elected officials, schools, or other community groups;  annual questionnaires or surveys; postings on social media and  email lists; and interactive websites. You may help build capabilities throughout the planning area by assigning the  responsibility for coordinating these activities to a staff member in each jurisdiction.  Coordinating a Multi-Jurisdictional Outreach Strategy If you are developing a multi-jurisdictional plan, the outreach strategy creates a mechanism for coordination and  accountability among the jurisdictions. For each jurisdiction seeking plan approval, the plan must document how  they were involved in the planning process, including how they provided opportunities for the involvement of their  stakeholders and the public.  Task 2 describes ways that the representatives on multi-jurisdictional planning teams can share information with  their respective community stakeholders and citizens. Specific stakeholders may be identified for each participating  jurisdiction, and public involvement activities should be designed to reach citizens throughout the planning area.  The planning team may develop one set of outreach materials, which each jurisdiction is responsible for distributing  or hosting to reach their stakeholders and citizens. Another good approach is to develop one presentation, or a series  of presentations on the plans progress, that jurisdictional representatives can deliver at a regularly scheduled open  meeting of their city council or governing body. This is a good method to keep elected officials informed of the  planning project and to give the public an opportunity to be informed and provide comments.  ", "1273": "Capability Assessment Each community has a unique set of capabilities, including  authorities, policies, programs, staff, funding, and other  resources available to accomplish mitigation and reduce long- term vulnerability. By reviewing the existing capabilities in each  jurisdiction, the planning team can identify capabilities that  currently reduce disaster losses or could be used to reduce losses  in the future, as well as capabilities that inadvertently increase risks  in the community. This is especially useful for multijurisdictional  plans where local capability varies widely. Task 6 describes how to  leverage capabilities for long-term vulnerability reduction in your  mitigation strategy. The planning team collects and reviews information on community  capabilities. The plan must describe each jurisdictions existing  authorities, policies, programs, and resources available to accomplish hazard mitigation. To review capabilities, begin  by reviewing existing plans, reports, and information and interviewing local departments and agencies to gain a  better understanding of relevant programs, regulations, resources, and practices. One approach is to distribute a  capabilities worksheet for each planning team members community or agency to complete. Appendix A includes an  example capabilities worksheet (see Worksheet 4.1).  Types of Capabilities The primary types of capabilities for reducing long-term  vulnerability through mitigation planning are the following:  Planning and regulatory  Administrative and technical   Financial  Education and outreach The planning team also may identify additional types of  capabilities relevant to mitigation planning.  ", "1274": "Planning and Regulatory Planning and regulatory capabilities are based on the  implementation of ordinances, policies, local laws and State statutes, and plans and programs that relate to guiding  and managing growth and development. Examples of planning capabilities that can either enable or inhibit  mitigation include comprehensive land use plans, capital improvements programs, transportation plans, small area  development plans, disaster recovery and reconstruction plans, and emergency preparedness and response plans.  Plans describe specific actions or policies that support community goals and drive decisions. Likewise, examples of  Element C1 The plan shall include a mitigation  strategy that provides the  jurisdictions blueprint for reducing  the potential losses identified in the  risk assessment, based on existing  authorities, policies, programs, and  resources, and its ability to expand  on and improve these existing tools. 44 CFR 201.6(c)(3) Safe Growth Audit One way to assess the impact of planning and  regulatory capabilities is to complete a safe  growth audit.* The purpose of the safe growth  audit is to analyze the impacts of current policies,  ordinances, and plans on community safety from  hazard risks due to growth. Basic safe growth  audit questions are included in Appendix A (see  Worksheet 4.2). * Godschalk, David R., Practice Safe Growth Audits;  Zoning Practice, Issue Number 10, October 2009;  American Planning Association. http://www.planning. org/zoningpractice/open/pdf/oct09.pdf4-2 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 4 Review Community Capabilities regulatory capabilities include the enforcement of zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, and building codes  that regulate how and where land is developed and structures are built. Planning and regulatory capabilities refer not  only to the current plans and regulations, but also to the communitys ability to change and improve those plans and  regulations as needed.", "1275": "Administrative and Technical  Administrative and technical capability refers to the communitys staff and their skills and tools that can be used  for mitigation planning and to implement specific mitigation actions. It also refers to the ability to access and  coordinate these resources effectively. Think about the types of personnel employed by each jurisdiction, the public  and private sector resources that may be accessed to implement mitigation activities in your community, and the  level of knowledge and technical expertise from all of these sources. These include engineers, planners, emergency  managers, GIS analysts, building inspectors, grant writers, floodplain managers, and more. For jurisdictions with  limited staff resources, capacity should also be considered; while staff members may have specific skills, they may  not have the time to devote to additional work tasks.  The planning team can identify resources available through other government entities, such as counties or special  districts, which may be able to provide technical assistance to communities with limited resources. For example, a  small town may turn to county planners, engineers, or a regional planning agency to support its mitigation planning  efforts and provide assistance. For large jurisdictions, reviewing administrative and technical capabilities may  involve targeting specific staff in various departments who have the expertise and are available to support mitigation  initiatives. The degree of intergovernmental coordination among departments also affects administrative capability.", "1276": "Financial Financial capabilities are the resources that a jurisdiction has access to or is eligible to use to fund mitigation  actions. The costs associated with implementing mitigation activities vary. Some mitigation actions such as building  assessment or outreach efforts require little to no costs other than staff time and existing operating budgets. Other  actions, such as the acquisition of flood-prone properties, could require a substantial monetary commitment from  local, State, and Federal funding sources.  Some local governments may have access to a recurring source of revenue beyond property, sales, and income taxes,  such as stormwater utility or development impact fees. These communities may be able to use the funds to support  local mitigation efforts independently or as the local match or cost-share often required for grant funding.", "1277": "Education and Outreach  This type of capability refers to education and outreach programs and methods already in place that could be used  to implement mitigation activities and communicate hazard-related information. Examples include fire safety  programs that fire departments deliver to students at local schools; participation in community programs, such  as Firewise1 or StormReady; 2  and activities conducted as part of hazard awareness campaigns, such as Tornado or  Flood Awareness Month. Some communities have their own public information or communications office to handle  outreach initiatives.", "1278": "Documentation of Community Capabilities The plan must document what existing plans, studies, reports, and  technical information were reviewed and how relevant information  was incorporated into the mitigation plan. To document means to  provide the factual evidence for how the jurisdictions developed  the plan. Documentation can be met with a narrative description,  but may also be shown in other formats. For example, a table or  list format may provide the relevant sources and explain how  information was incorporated, or citations or footnotes throughout  the document may demonstrate incorporation of other plans.  For multi-jurisdictional plans, the capabilities of each participating jurisdiction must be individually  reviewed and documented. In a plan update, the planning team ensures capabilities are documented  sufficiently and highlights any capability changes from the previous plan.", "1279": "The planning team conducts a risk assessment to determine the potential impacts of hazards to the people, economy,  and built and natural environments of the community. The risk assessment provides the foundation for the rest of  the mitigation planning process, which is focused on identifying and prioritizing actions to reduce risk to hazards.  In addition to informing the mitigation strategy, the risk assessment also can be used to establish emergency  preparedness and response priorities, for land use and comprehensive planning, and for decision making by elected  officials, city and county departments, businesses, and organizations in the community.  Task 5 presents a framework for conducting a local risk assessment. Many approaches to developing a risk assessment  are possible, depending on available data, technology, and resources. Local risk assessments do not require  sophisticated technology but do need to be accurate, current, and relevant. Some communities may choose to  address a broader range of threats and hazards, or to tie their hazard identification and risk assessment to other  planning initiatives.", "1280": "Steps to Conduct a Risk Assessment Figure 5.2 shows the four recommended steps for conducting a risk  assessment. The desired outcomes of these steps are 1) an evaluation of  each hazards potential impacts on the people, economy, and built and  natural environments in the planning area and 2) an understanding of  each communitys overall vulnerability and most significant risks. These  potential impacts and the overall vulnerability can be used to create problem  statements and identify mitigation actions to reduce risk. For multi-jurisdictional planning efforts, the risk assessment must result  in an evaluation of potential impacts and overall vulnerability that each  participating jurisdiction will use to development specific mitigation actions.  Assets, vulnerabilities, and overall risk are unique to each community and  must be addressed in a multi-jurisdictional plan. Although hazards  may be described for the entire planning area, the plan also must  explain any hazards that are unique or varied within communities.  A mitigation plan update focuses on how risk has  changed since the previous plan was completed,  particularly changes related to land use development  and new hazard information. New development in  hazard-prone areas, areas affected by recent disasters, and new  data and reports are examples of information that should be  incorporated into the plan to analyze the current risk and update  problem statements. Because the best available data is constantly changing, this Handbook does not include a comprehensive list of  resources. The local community is the best source for specific information on community assets and past impacts.  Your State Hazard Mitigation Officer and the State Hazard Mitigation Plan are also key resources for best available  hazard data and risk assessment information.  ", "1281": "1. Describe Hazards The plan must include a description of the natural hazards that  affect the jurisdiction(s) in the planning area. The following  provides suggestions for identifying hazards in the planning area:   Review your State Hazard Mitigation Plan for information on  hazards affecting the planning area.  Document the disaster declaration history.1  Download weather-related events from online resources, such  as the National Climatic Data Center. 2  Review existing studies, reports, and plans related to hazards in  the planning area. State and Federal agencies are also good sources for hazard-related information. 1 For recent disaster declaration information, visit FEMAs Federal Disaster Declarations webpage, http://www.fema.gov/news/disasters.fema.  PERI Presidential Disaster Declarations are available at http://www.peripresdecusa.org/mainframe.htm. The Farm Services Agency Disaster  Assistance provides assistance for natural disaster losses, resulting from drought, flood, fire, freeze, tornadoes, pest infestation, and other  calamities. For more information, visit: http://www.fsa.usda.gov/FSA/webapp?area=home&subject=diap&topic=landing. 2 Websites of the National Climatic Data Center, http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/, and the Spatial Hazard Events and Losses Database for the  United States (SHELDUS), http://webra.cas.sc.edu/hvri/products/sheldus.aspx, compile county-level hazard data sets. Figure 5.2: Steps to conduct a risk  assessment Element B1 The risk assessment shall include a  description of the type, location and  extent of all natural hazards that can  affect the jurisdiction.  44 CFR 201.6(c)(2)(i) Element B1 For multi-jurisdictional plans, the risk  assessment section must assess each  jurisdictions risks where they vary from  the risks facing the entire planning  area.  44 CFR 201.6(c)(2)(iii) 5-3 Task 5 Conduct a Risk Assessment  Use flood insurance rate maps (FIRM) and non-regulatory flood risk assessment products developed for your  community by FEMA as part of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the RiskMAP program. 3  Contact colleges or universities that have hazard-related academic programs or extension services.  Interview your planning team and stakeholders about which hazards affect the planning area and should be  described in the mitigation plan.   Consult local resources such as the newspaper, chamber of commerce, local historical society, or other resources  with records of past occurrences.  For plan updates, reference hazards previously identified and determine if they are still relevant.  If your plan omits a natural hazard that is commonly recognized to affect the planning area, it must include the  planning teams rationale for the omission. For example, a hazard may be possible, but the likelihood and magnitude  are so minimal that the planning team decides not to provide a detailed description or risk assessment.  Hazard Descriptions For each hazard affecting the planning area, the risk assessment must include a description of location,  extent, previous occurrences, and probability of future events. Plan updates will incorporate any additional  hazards that have been identified and any new data that has become available, such as new flood studies.  Plan updates must include hazard events that have occurred since the last plan was completed. Location. Location is the geographic areas within the planning area that are affected by the hazard, such as a  floodplain. Hazard areas may be further defined, such as high wildfire hazard areas versus low wildfire hazard areas.  The entire planning area may be uniformly affected by some hazards, such as drought or winter storm. Although  maps are usually the best way to illustrate location for many hazards, location may be described in other formats,  such as a narrative.  Extent. Extent is the strength or magnitude of the hazard. Extent can be described in a combination of ways  depending on the hazard, such as:  The value on an established scientific scale or measurement system, such as EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale for  tornadoes or 5.5 on the Richter Scale for earthquakes.   Other measures of magnitude, such as water depth or wind speed.  The speed of onset. For example, hurricanes have longer warning times, giving people and governments more  time to prepare and evacuate, while earthquakes occur without warning.   The duration of hazard events. For most hazards, the longer the duration of an event, the greater the extent.  Flooding that peaks and retreats in a matter of hours is typically less damaging than flooding of the same depth  that remains in place for days.  Extent can be described using a map and/or narrative. Describing the extent of a hazard is not the same as  describing its potential impacts on a community. Extent defines the characteristics of the hazard regardless of  the people and property it affects, while impact refers to the effect of a hazard on the people and property in the  community and will be addressed later in Task 5.  3 More information on the Risk MAP program is available at http://www.fema.gov/rm-main.5-4 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 5 Conduct a Risk Assessment Previous occurrences. The plan must include the history of  previous hazard events for each hazard. This information helps  estimate the likelihood of future events and predict potential  impacts. For some hazards, it may be helpful to compile past  events in tables. When data is available, describe the extent of the  event and impacts, such as fatalities and injuries, building and  infrastructure damages, and loss of services. Understanding the  extent and impacts of past hazard events will help you anticipate  potential damage from future events.", "1282": "Probability of future events. Probability is the likelihood of the hazard occurring in the future and can be  described in a variety of ways. Probability may be defined using historical frequencies or statistical probabilities.  Statistical probabilities often refer to events of a specific size or strength. For example, the likelihood of a flood event  of a given size is defined by the percent chance in a single year, such as the one-percent annual chance of flood,  also known as a 100-year flood. Hazard likelihood can also be compared using general descriptions or rankings. If", "1283": "general descriptors are used, then they must be defined in the plan. For example, highly likely could be defined  as occurring every 1-10 years, likely as occurring every 10-50 years, and unlikely as occurring at intervals  greater than 50 years. Some hazards are most likely during a specific time of year, but others can occur at any time.  For example, flooding might be more frequent in the spring because of snow melt or during late summer or fall  because of the hurricane season.", "1284": "Displaying Hazard Information The following figures illustrate how communities have used maps to describe the location, extent, previous  occurrences, and/or probability of future events for various hazards. Note that one map can be used to describe  several hazard characteristics.

The planning team can include  climate change as a separate section in the plan or within the  descriptions of the existing hazards, such as severe storms,  flooding, wildfire, and drought. Climate adaptation strategies,  which are adjustments in natural or human systems to mitigate  the impacts of a changing environment, may complement  other hazard mitigation strategies.

Identify Community Assets  In this next step, each participating jurisdiction identifies  assets at risk to hazards. Assets are defined broadly to include  anything that is important to the character and function of a  community and can be described very generally in the following four categories:   People   Economy  Built environment  Natural environment Although all assets may be affected by hazards, some assets are more vulnerable because of their physical  characteristics or socioeconomic uses. The purpose of an asset inventory is to identify specific vulnerable  assets in your community. When updating a mitigation plan, the planning team will update the asset  inventory to reflect current conditions.", "1289": "People People are your most important asset. The risk assessment  can identify areas of greater population density, as well as  populations that may have unique vulnerabilities or be less able  to respond and recover during a disaster. These include visiting  populations and access and functional needs populations. In  addition, the risk assessment can identify locations that provide  health or social services that are critical to post-disaster response  or recovery capabilities. Visiting populations include students, second home owners,  migrant farm workers, and visitors for special events. Special  events could include large sporting events and festivals where  large numbers of people are concentrated and vulnerable to  hazards and threats. Visiting populations may be less familiar  with the local environment and hazards and less prepared to  protect themselves during an event. The term access and functional needs populations describes  groups that may not comfortably or safely access the standard resources offered in emergencies. These populations  may include children, the elderly, the physically or mentally disabled, non-English speakers, or the medically or  chemically dependent. Facility locations and support service operations for these populations (e.g., hospitals,  dependent care facilities, oxygen delivery, and accessible transportation) also need to be considered.  A variety of data sources are available to help collect information on population, such as the U.S. Census, 7  state  population estimates, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 8  Creating maps that show facilities that house  dependent populations or venues that host large numbers of people will help illustrate the relationship between  population and potential hazards.", "1290": "Economy After a disaster, economic resiliency drives recovery. Every  community has specific economic drivers that are important to  understand when planning to reduce the impacts of hazards and  disasters to the local economy. Economic assets can be described  in terms of direct or indirect losses; for example, building or  inventory damage is direct, but functional downtime and loss  of employment wages are indirect losses that can be calculated.  In addition to the primary economic sectors in the community,  such as manufacturing, agricultural, or service sectors, major  employers and commercial centers also support the local  economy.

Areas of future growth and development are also an important  component when assessing the building environment. Existing Structures. All structures are exposed to risk, but  certain buildings or concentrations of buildings may be  more vulnerable because of their location, age, construction  type, condition, or use. Consult the local tax assessor and  planning department for information on land use, zoning,  parcel boundaries and ownership, and types and numbers of  structures.  Infrastructure. Infrastructure systems are critical for life safety  and economic viability and include transportation, power,  communication, and water and wastewater systems. Many  critical facilities depend on infrastructure to function. For  example, hospitals need electricity, water, and sewer to continue  helping patients. As with critical facilities, the continued  operations of infrastructure systems during and following a  disaster are key factors in the severity of impacts and the speed of recovery.  Critical facilities. Critical facilities are structures and institutions necessary for a communitys response to and  recovery from emergencies. Critical facilities must continue to operate during and following a disaster to reduce the  severity of impacts and accelerate recovery. When identifying vulnerabilities, consider both the structural integrity  and content value of critical facilities and the effects of interrupting their services to the community.

An effective way to reduce future losses  in your community is to avoid development in known hazard  areas and to enforce the development of safe structures in other  areas. In other words, keep people, businesses, and buildings  out of harms way from the beginning. The plan should provide  a general description of community land uses and development  trends so that mitigation options can be considered in  future land use decisions to ensure safe development. Local  comprehensive or master plans may have information on future  land use and build-out scenarios.", "1294": "Natural Environment Environmental assets and natural resources are important  to community identity and quality of life and support the  economy through agriculture, tourism and recreation, and a  variety of other ecosystem services, such as clean air and water.  The natural environment also provides protective functions  that reduce hazard impacts and increase resiliency. For instance,  wetlands and riparian areas help absorb flood waters, soils  and landscaping contribute to stormwater management,  and vegetation provides erosion control and reduces runoff.  Conservation of environmental assets may present opportunities  to meet mitigation and other community objectives, such as  protecting sensitive habitat, developing parks and trails, or  contributing to the economy.

The  purpose of this analysis is to help the community understand  the greatest risks facing the planning area. This step occurs after  hazards and assets have been identified.  Methods for analyzing risk include exposure analysis, historical  analysis, and scenario analysis. These methods can be expressed  qualitatively or quantitatively. Qualitative evaluations describe  the types of impacts that might occur during a hazard event. The  planning team, subject matter experts, stakeholders, and community members can conduct qualitative evaluations  by brainstorming and discussing potential impacts. Quantitative evaluations assign values and measure the potential  losses to the assets at risk.", "1296": "Exposure Analysis An exposure analysis identifies the existing and future assets located in identified hazard areas, often by using GIS for  analysis and maps for visualization. You also can take into account the magnitude of the hazard, such as assets located  in high, medium, or low wildfire hazard areas or assets located in different flood frequency areas (1% annual flood  and 0.2% annual flood risk).  Exposure analysis can quantify the number, type, and value of structures, critical facilities, and infrastructure located  in identified hazard areas, as well as assets exposed to multiple hazards. It can also be used to quantify the number of  future structures and infrastructure possible in hazard prone areas based on current zoning and building codes.

This can be especially useful for weather-related hazards, such as severe  winter storms, hail, and drought. Because of the frequency of these events, communities are more likely to have  experience with and data on impacts and losses. For recent events, consider not only what was damaged, but what  might have been damaged if the event had been of greater magnitude. For hazard events that have not occurred  recently, consider new development and infrastructure that would  now be vulnerable in a similar event. The plan must address NFIP-insured structures that have been  repetitively damaged by floods. The definitions for repetitive  loss are below. Information on repetitive loss properties in your  community can be obtained from your State NFIP coordinator or  local floodplain administrator.", "1298": "Scenario Analysis Scenario analysis predicts the impacts of a particular event. Scenarios can be an especially helpful tool for low  frequency, high consequence events, such as earthquakes, for which historical information is not available.

The purpose of a risk index is to compare  hazards and rank which pose the greatest risk. Each hazard is  given a rank based on probability, magnitude, impacts, and  other characteristics of risk. A risk index can be a helpful way to  compare multiple hazards, but it is not a complete risk assessment. The plan must include the process for analysis  and the data underlying the values calculated in the index.  Regardless of how the results are expressed or the methods of analysis used, this step must result in a description of  the potential impacts of each hazard on the assets of each participating jurisdiction.

Summarize Vulnerability The previous three steps in the risk assessment process generate  large amounts of information regarding hazards, vulnerable  assets, and potential impacts and losses. This information needs  to be summarized so that the community can understand the  most significant risks and vulnerabilities, not only to inform the  mitigation strategy, but also to communicate findings to elected  officials and other stakeholders to support their decision making.  The plan must provide an overall summary of each jurisdictions  vulnerability to the identified hazards. One recommended approach is to develop problem statements. For instance, your analysis of impacts and losses  helps you to identify which critical facilities are located in identified hazard areas, the neighborhood that has  experienced the most flood damage in the past, or which hazard-prone areas are zoned for future development. This  information on the issues of greatest concern can be summarized into problem statements, such as in the following  examples. The planning team may evaluate the impacts and develop problem statements for each hazard, as well as  identify the problems or issues that apply to all hazards. Plan updates will need to revise the problems statements to reflect the current risk assessment. This may  include developing new statements and removing or revising ones that are no longer valid because  mitigation projects have addressed the risk or other conditions have changed.

Examples include:  Creating mutual aid agreements with neighboring communities to meet emergency response needs.  Purchasing radio communications equipment for the Fire Department.  Developing procedures for notifying citizens of available shelter locations during and following an event. For some hazards, such as tornados, including preparedness actions in the mitigation plan may be necessary  and practical. The mitigation plan may be the best place for your community to capture and justify the need for  these actions.

As described in Task 5, these impacts and vulnerabilities  may be summarized in problem statements. Some hazards may not  have many impacts, or the impacts may already be mitigated.

A greater understanding  and awareness of hazards and risk among local  officials, stakeholders, and the public is more  likely to lead to direct actions.

For  example, building retrofits, infrastructure protection, and changes in local ordinances represent a mix of structural  and non-structural approaches. In addition, each jurisdiction must consider actions that reduce risk to existing  buildings and infrastructure, as well as limit risk to new development and redevelopment.  The planning team may identify low-cost mitigation actions that can be readily implemented, such as developing  an outreach program to encourage homeowners to secure furnishings and utilities to prevent injuries and damage  during an earthquake. Other actions may depend on available funding, such as retrofitting critical infrastructure.  Though funding and support may not be immediately available for every action, including the actions in the plan  may lead to future opportunities for implementation. For example, some actions can be implemented following a  disaster when additional funding and political and public support are available, such as acquiring homes in a flood  hazard area. Additionally, if actions are not included in the plan, securing funding may be more difficult once it  becomes available. To identify potential mitigation actions, the planning team needs to review the risk assessment and assess  capabilities.  1. Review Risk Assessment The planning team should start with the problem statements developed from the risk assessment. For each problem  statement, consider different types of mitigation actions for addressing the problem. See the example on the page  6-6.  You may have multiple ideas that are categorized under one type (e.g., education and awareness or local plans and  regulations) and no ideas under another type. However, the intent is to think comprehensively when identifying  potential actions and to consider future development.  ", "1315": ". Assess Capabilities The mitigation strategy is based on existing local authorities, policies, programs, and resources, as well as the ability  to expand on and improve these existing tools. As part of Task 4, the planning team reviewed existing capabilities for  reducing long-term vulnerability to hazards. Those capabilities can be assessed to identify gaps to be addressed and  strengths to enhance through new mitigation actions. For instance, can gaps in design or enforcement of existing  regulations be addressed through additional personnel or a change in procedure or policy? Could an existing  education program be improved to cover the most significant hazards and better target non-English speakers? Are  additional studies, reports, or plans needed to understand risk?  Jurisdictions participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) can consider actions to enhance their  floodplain management program, such as addressing repetitive loss properties and improving standards beyond the  minimum requirements for NFIP participation.  Communities also must consider actions that reduce risk to future development. The planning team can evaluate  the effects of current growth plans and regulations (i.e., comprehensive plans, zoning and subdivisions ordinances,  building codes, and capital improvement programs) on community safety and consider how these could be updated  to reduce the communitys vulnerability. For instance, development review procedures may be revised to include a  hazard assessment for new development. The types of questions that the community can ask include:  Will population growth and future land use plans put more people in hazardous areas?  Will current redevelopment policies increase the population and property vulnerable to hazards?  Will planned infrastructure extensions encourage unsafe development by facilitating access to hazardous areas?", "1316": "Evaluating and Prioritizing Mitigation Actions Not all of the identified actions may be included in the final action plan because of technical feasibility, political  acceptance, lack of funding, and other constraints. The planning team will evaluate and prioritize the most suitable  mitigation actions for the community to implement. The plan must include a mitigation strategy that 1) analyzes  actions and/or projects considered to reduce the impacts of hazards identified in the risk assessment and 2)  identifies the actions and/or projects that each jurisdiction intends to implement.  Benefit-Cost Review The one criterion that must be part of the evaluation and  prioritization process is benefit-cost review. That is, the planning  team must consider the benefits that would result from a  mitigation action versus the cost. This does not mean a full benefit- cost analysis, such as the FEMA BCA Module, 1  but a planning level  assessment of whether the costs are reasonable compared to the  probable benefits. Cost estimates do not have to be exact but can be  based on experience and judgment.  Benefits include losses avoided, such as the number and value  of structures and infrastructure protected by the action and the  population protected from injury and loss of life. Qualitative  benefits, such as quality of life and natural and beneficial functions  of ecosystems, can also be included in the review. Evaluation Criteria The planning team needs to agree upon the other criteria that will  be used to analyze the mitigation actions. Suggested criteria and  sample planning team questions to evaluate each mitigation action  alternative include:  Life safety. How effectively will the action protect lives and  prevent injuries?  Property protection. How significant will the action  be at eliminating or reducing damage to structures and  infrastructure?  Technical. Is the mitigation action technically feasible?  Is it a long-term solution? Eliminate actions that, from a  technical standpoint, will not meet the goals.   Political. Does the public support the mitigation action? Is  there the political will to support it?", "1317": "Legal. Does the community have the authority to implement the action?  Environmental. What are the potential environmental impacts of the action? Will it comply with environmental  regulations?   Social. Will the proposed action adversely affect one segment of the population? Will the action disrupt  established neighborhoods, break up voting districts, or cause the relocation of lower income people?  Administrative. Does the community have the personnel and administrative capabilities to implement the  action and maintain it, or will outside help be necessary?   Local champion. Is there a strong advocate for the action or project among local departments and agencies who  will support the actions implementation?  Other community objectives. Does the action advance other community objectives, such as capital  improvements, economic development, environmental quality, or open space preservation? Does it support the  policies of the comprehensive plan? Action Prioritization  After careful evaluation, the planning team will have a list of actions that are acceptable and practical for addressing  the problems identified in the risk assessment. The planning team can prioritize actions for implementation by  assessing the importance of each item relative to the plans goals and the risks and capabilities. Actions could  be prioritized by numerical ranking; high, medium, or low designation; chronological ranking by date of  implementation; or other methods. Prioritization may change over time in response to changes in community  characteristics and risks and to take advantage of available resources. The evaluation and prioritization process helps the planning team weigh the pros and cons of different action  alternatives. However, the decision-making process is not necessarily straightforward; it is highly specific to each  jurisdiction. The example that follows describes one approach for identifying and prioritizing mitigation actions.  Your process should be appropriate for the size, number, and capabilities of the communities involved. Each  participating jurisdiction may have different priorities for implementing actions. Appendix A includes an example of  a worksheet that could be used to facilitate the evaluation and prioritization process (see Worksheet 6.1).", "1318": "Incorporation into Existing Plans and Procedures For a community to succeed in reducing risks in the long term, the  information and recommendations of the mitigation plan should  be integrated throughout government operations. Through the  planning process, partnerships are formed, and sustained action  can increase the communitys resilience to disasters. Many other  local plans, such as comprehensive, stormwater management,  sustainability, economic development, and area plans present  opportunities to address hazard mitigation in a way that can  support multiple community objectives. Mitigation plans must  describe the communitys process to integrate the data, analysis,  and mitigation goals and actions into other planning mechanisms.  First, the plan must identify the existing planning mechanisms  where hazard mitigation information and actions may be incorporated. In this context, planning mechanisms mean  governance structures used to manage local land use development and community decision making. The review of  community capabilities described in Task 4 identifies this information. Multi-jurisdictional plans must describe each  participating jurisdictions individual process for integrating the plan into their local planning mechanisms. In some cases, a community may choose to develop their hazard mitigation plan wholly within their comprehensive  planning process. Hazard Mitigation: Integrating Best Practices into Planning2 provides technical advice and examples of  communities that have successfully integrated mitigation into local comprehensive plans and other types of  local planning processes. Some existing processes may not allow for integration due to timing, budgets, or other  constraints. For example, a community may determine that the goals and actions of the hazard mitigation plan will  be considered in the next 5-year capital improvements planning process, which may be updated annually.  To identify how the plan can be incorporated into other plans, programs, and procedures, consider the following:  Integrate Plan Goals with other Community Objectives The overall mission and goals for risk reduction and community  safety may be incorporated into the objectives and policies of  other plans. Goals for disaster resiliency can also complement  the sustainability programs being developed by many  communities. The following are examples of policies that can  be included in the comprehensive plan and are implemented  through zoning and building codes, capital improvements  programs, and permitting processes:   Protect life and property in high hazard areas by limiting  densities of new development   Limit the extension of public infrastructure in high hazard  areas  Reduce the vulnerability of future development in high  hazard areas by reviewing development regulations  ", "1319": "Use the Risk Assessment to Inform Plans and Policies The risk assessment provides data, analysis, and maps that can be integrated into other plans to inform policies and  decision-making. For instance, the risk assessment can form the basis for other emergency management program  activities, including the emergency operations and evacuation planning. Incorporation of hazard information and  mapping into land use plans, zoning and subdivision codes, and the development review process can guide growth  and redevelopment away from high-risk locations. This information can also be used to design and site future public  facilities to minimize exposure to hazards.  ", "1320": "Implement Mitigation Actions through Existing Mechanisms Where possible, the community should implement the identified mitigation actions through existing plans and  policies, which already have support from the community and policy makers. For instance, a Community Wildfire  Protection Plan3  identifies a communitys priorities for wildfire fuel reduction projects. A capital improvements  program outlines a jurisdictions spending plan for capital projects that support existing and future developments,  such as roads, water, and sewer systems, usually over a 5-year period. Mitigation projects that could be included in  the capital improvements plan include strengthening at-risk critical facilities or acquiring open space in identified  hazard areas. Other implementation tools for mitigation actions could include staff work plans, permitting  procedures, job descriptions, and training.", "1321": "Implementation of Mitigation Actions The action plan also identifies how specific mitigation actions will  be implemented, including who is responsible for which actions,  what funding mechanisms and other resources are available or  will be pursued, when the actions will be completed, and how  they are prioritized. The capability assessment developed in Task 4  can be helpful in determining the agencies responsible for certain  functions in the community and the available financial resources. Assign Responsible Agency The planning team needs to determine which department or  agency is most appropriate to lead each action. In order to clearly  describe how actions will be implemented and administered,  at a minimum, a specific agency, department, or position must  be assigned to the action, not the jurisdiction as a whole. If  coordinating with other agencies will be necessary, this is a good  time for them to provide input on the steps and timeframes  necessary to carry out the actions.", "1322": "Identify Potential Resources Resources include funding, technical assistance, and materials. Estimating the cost of an action will help the  planning team target the most appropriate resources. Sources of local funding may include the general operating  budget, capital improvement budgets, staff time, impact fees, special assessment districts, and more. Your State  Hazard Mitigation Officer and the FEMA mitigation planning webpage can help you identify potential State and  Federal resources. The planning team should also consider opportunities for private sector funding and partnerships,  as well as resources that may be provided by academic institutions. Estimate the Timeframe The planning team and responsible agencies must develop a timeframe for implementing each mitigation action.  Funding cycles can affect when you can begin implementing an action. The timeframe can detail when the action  will be started, interim steps, and when it should be fully implemented. Timeframes can also be general, such as 3  to 5 years, or defined for short, medium, and long term.  Other implementation items that you may consider describing in the action plan are goals addressed, partner  agencies, steps for implementation, and estimated budget. An action implementation worksheet can be a good  approach for formatting the information collected for each action and its implementation. An example worksheet  is provided in Appendix A (see Worksheet 6.2). The planning team may decide to assign the responsible agency for  each action first. Each agency can then be responsible for developing the action implementation worksheet with  additional information on how the action will be administered and implemented. If appropriate, the community  can also begin developing project scopes of work, schedules, and budgets, particularly where Federal funding  applications are anticipated. FEMAs approval of the plan does not mean approved funding for projects identified in  the plan or an approved application for Federal assistance.", "1323": "Updating the Mitigation Strategy One of the most important steps in updating your plan is to refine the communitys mitigation strategy, particularly  in light of experiences gained from the implementation of the previous plan. To continue to be an effective  representation of the jurisdictions overall strategy for reducing risk to natural hazards, the updated  local mitigation plan must reflect current conditions and progress in mitigation efforts. The 5-year plan  update is an opportunity for each jurisdiction to assess its previous goals and actions, evaluate progress in  implementing the action plan, and adjust its actions to address current realities. The mitigation strategy should also  be revised following disasters to determine if the recommended actions are still appropriate given the impacts of the  event.  Evaluate Progress in Implementation Plan updates must reflect progress in local mitigation efforts.  Whereas goals may not change significantly over a 5-year  timeframe, the integration of the plan into existing planning  mechanisms and the implementation of mitigation actions  demonstrate progress in risk reduction.", "1324": "Integration of Hazard Mitigation  The updated plan must explain how the jurisdiction(s)  incorporated the previous mitigation plan, when appropriate,  into other planning mechanisms over the last 5 years as a demonstration of progress in local mitigation efforts.  The updated plan must continue to describe how the current mitigation strategy, including the goals and hazard  mitigation actions, will be incorporated into other planning mechanisms over the next 5 years.", "1325": "Completion of Mitigation Actions The plan also must describe the status of the mitigation actions identified in the previous plan by describing those  that have been completed or not completed. For actions that have not been completed, the plan must either describe  whether the action is no longer relevant or indicate whether it is included as part of the updated action plan.  The planning team may ask the local agencies and departments assigned responsibility for the implementation of  mitigation actions in the previous plan to provide a status update on each of their actions. For instance, agencies  could provide an evaluation of the following:   If the action was completed, did it have the intended results? Did it achieve the goals outlined in the plan? What  factors contributed to success?  If the action was not completed, what were the barriers to implementation? For instance, was there a lack of  political support, funding, staff availability, or other obstacle? Should the action be included in the updated  mitigation strategy? Task 7 describes how to develop a process for monitoring and evaluating the plan that can be used to evaluate  progress.  ", "1326": "Describe Changes in Priorities The plan must describe if and how any priorities changed since  the plan was previously approved. Your communitys mitigation  priorities may change over time for a variety of reasons. Addressing  changes in priorities allows you to redirect actions to reflect  current conditions, including financial and political realities,  or changes in conditions or priorities due to disaster events. In  addition, now that the community has implemented some actions,  you may apply lessons learned about what works and does not.  New actions can be identified based on the updated risk assessment and capability assessment. New actions are  prioritized in combination with the actions carried forward from the previous plan. Factors that may influence  changes in priorities include the following:  Altered conditions due to disaster events and recovery priorities  Changing local resources, community needs, and capabilities  New State or Federal policies and funding resources  New hazard impacts identified in the updated risk assessment  Changes in development patterns that could influence the effects of hazards  New partners that have come to the table If no changes in priorities are necessary, plan updates may validate the information in the previously approved plan.", "1327": "Communicating the Mitigation Action Plan You may consider how to present the final action plan in a format that can be easily used and referenced by  community members and officials. The mitigation strategy or action plan is the primary tool to obtain funding,  assign priorities, guide the decision making process, and track progress in future plan updates. A matrix, such as the  example provided on page 6-14, can be a good format for summarizing information on the recommended actions.  You also may consider including this information along with the mission and goals in the front of the plan in the  form of an executive summary. This allows users to quickly understand how the community plans to reduce risk to  hazards and strengthen disaster resiliency.", "1328": "Plan Maintenance Procedures Plan maintenance is the process the planning team establishes  to track the plans implementation progress and to inform the  plan update. The plan must include a description of the method  and schedule for monitoring, evaluating, and updating it within  a 5-year cycle. These procedures help to:  Ensure that the mitigation strategy is implemented  according to the plan.  Provide the foundation for an ongoing mitigation program  in your community.   Standardize long-term monitoring of hazard-related  activities.  Integrate mitigation principles into community officials  daily job responsibilities and department roles.  Maintain momentum through continued engagement and  accountability in the plans progress. Plan updates provide the opportunity to consider  how well the procedures established in the previously  approved plan worked and revise them as needed.  ", "1329": "Monitoring Implementation Plan monitoring means tracking the implementation of the plan over time. The plan must identify how, when, and  by whom the plan will be monitored. For example, the plan may describe a monitoring system for tracking the  status of the identified mitigation actions and reporting this information on a quarterly basis. The responsible agency  assigned to each mitigation action may be responsible for tracking and reporting on each of their actions. Appendix  A includes an example worksheet for reporting progress on a mitigation action (see Worksheet 7.1).  The planning team must identify the lead position or agency, usually the same individual or agency leading the  plans development, for coordinating the monitoring process. A method and schedule for regular monitoring can  include reports or other deliverables and expectations for meeting attendance. Monitoring, therefore, becomes part  of the regular administrative function of the offices or positions to which it is assigned", "1330": "Evaluating Effectiveness Evaluating means assessing the effectiveness of the plan at achieving its stated purpose and goals. The planning team  must identify how, when, and by whom the plan will be evaluated. The planning team may develop a list of metrics  to evaluate progress toward goals on an annual basis. For instance, if a goal is to improve public awareness of  hazards and risk, then repeat a survey conducted during the planning process on an annual or 5-year basis to gauge  Element A6 The plan maintenance process shall  include a section describing the method  and schedule of monitoring, evaluating,  evaluating, and updating the mitigation  plan within a five-year cycle. 44 CFR 201.6(c)(4)(i) Develop Procedures For: Monitoring. Tracking the implementation of the  plan over time. Evaluating. Assessing the effectiveness of the  plan at achieving its stated purpose and goals. Updating. Reviewing and revising the plan at  least once every 5 years.7-2 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 7 Keep the Plan Current how perception of risk is changing. If a goal is to reduce the number of structures in hazard prone areas, evaluate  how these numbers change over time. The planning team could also evaluate the percentage of actions implemented.  Plan evaluation may not occur as frequently as plan monitoring, but it is an important step to ensure that the plan  continues to serve a purpose. Many communities commit to, at a minimum, annually reconvening the planning  team to evaluate the plans effectiveness and to prepare a report for their governing bodies that demonstrates  progress to date. This information also serves as the basis of the next plan update.  The planning team or, if applicable, a subset of the planning team assigned to evaluate the plan, may develop a  schedule for both regular meetings and specific deliverables. To maximize funding opportunities, schedule the  meetings to coincide with an existing process or procedure, such as the community budget cycle or FEMAs annual  grant cycle. If reports or other deliverables are necessary, determine their frequency and reporting requirements.", "1331": "Updating the Plan Updating means reviewing and revising the plan at least once every 5 years to reflect changes in development,  progress in local mitigation efforts, and changes in priorities. The planning team must identify how, when, and by  whom the plan will be updated. Documenting the procedures for updating the plan requires an explanation of who  will be responsible for updating the plan and when and how this process will be initiated. The plan must include  the title of the individual or name of the department or agency responsible for leading the updating effort. It may  be appropriate to include a schedule of activities that allows sufficient time to obtain funding for and complete the  planning process before the plan expires.  The planning team can also establish procedures for updating the plan following a disaster event or concurrent with  the development of a recovery or post-disaster redevelopment plan. Your communitys vulnerabilities and mitigation  priorities often change following a disaster, and additional funding sources may become available, such as FEMAs  Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or Public Assistance. Generally, public awareness increases, and the demand and  support for mitigation frequently increases following a disaster. You may choose to take advantage of opportunities  to incorporate mitigation into recovery strategies and to rebuild wisely and safely to avoid similar losses in the  future. This is also an important time to collect data on the hazard and its impacts for future plan updates. If you are  considering developing a recovery plan prior to a disaster, coordinating the recovery and mitigation planning efforts  promotes messages about building resilience.  ", "1332": "Continue Public Involvement Keeping the plan current also means continuing to provide  opportunities for public involvement in the plan and its  implementation. Task 3 describes this requirement and offers  suggestions for continuing outreach to the public and other  stakeholders during plan maintenance and implementation. You  may choose to document how the community will continue  public participation during the plan maintenance process, along  with the procedures for monitoring, evaluating, and updating  the plan. The planning team also may identify specific procedures for  keeping elected officials involved, either through the monitoring and evaluation procedures and/or through the  process for continuing public participation. The local governing body usually adopts the plan, so reporting back  to them annually or at other regular intervals can help maintain support and provide accountability for those  responsible for the plans maintenance and implementation.", "1333": "Local Plan Review When you have completed a final draft of the plan, the planning team can publicize the mitigation plan and ask  stakeholders and the public to review and submit comments for the planning teams final consideration. Task 3   Create an Outreach Strategy describes how the public must be given the opportunity to review and comment on the  mitigation plan prior to its adoption. Suggestions for how to meet this requirement are also described in more  detail in Task 3. A good approach provides the public sufficient time to comment and explains how comments will  be used.  You may also directly inform certain stakeholders of the plans availability for comment, such as through an email  or letter. This is a particularly good approach for providing neighboring jurisdictions an opportunity to review the  mitigation plan. The plan itself can include information on the types of comments received and how comments  were incorporated. Prior to submitting the plan to the State Hazard Mitigation Officer (SHMO), the planning team may validate that  the local mitigation plan meets all requirements of Title 44 Code of Regulations (CFR) 201.6. FEMA uses the Local  Mitigation Plan Review Tool to ensure that approved local mitigation plans meet these requirements. The planning team  may view the Regulation Checklist portion of the Plan Review Tool and fill in the page numbers where your plan  meets each of the required elements. This can serve as a final internal review to confirm the plan meets Federal  requirements prior to submitting it for approval. Appendix B provides a copy of the Local Mitigation Plan Review Tool.", "1334": "Submitting the Plan Once the planning team is confident the plan meets the  required elements and includes all supporting documentation,  forward the plan to your SHMO or State Mitigation Planner.  It is critical that all supporting documentation related to  the planning process and other components of the plan are  included in the initial submittal. Incomplete plan submittals  can delay plan approval. The State will review the plan and work  with you on any required revisions for approval. Dont forget  to provide your local contact information where you can be  reached for any questions. Once the State is satisfied that the plan meets the requirements,  the SHMO will forward the plan to the FEMA Regional Office  for review and approval. FEMA will conduct its review within  45 days, if possible, and provide a completed Local Mitigation  Plan Review Tool to the State. The FEMA Regional Office and  the State may contact you to discuss additional revisions to the Figure 8.1: Plan approval process8-2 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 8 Review and Adopt the Plan plan to ensure that it meets the Federal regulation. Once FEMA determines the plan meets the regulation, FEMA will  notify the SHMO that the plan is approvable pending adoption (APA), or approved if the community has already  adopted the mitigation plan.", "1335": "Approvable Pending Adoption To avoid repeated attempts to adopt the plan prior to FEMA approval, many communities obtain a notice from FEMA  that the plan is APA before adopting the plan. As a time-saving measure, communities are encouraged to submit  the final draft of the mitigation plan to the State and FEMA for review prior to formal adoption by the elected  officials or other authorized governing body. If FEMA determines the plan is not approvable and requires revisions,  the community will be able to make revisions before initiating the plan adoption process, therefore avoiding  unnecessary delays in plan approval.", "1336": "Plan Approval Upon receiving the record of adoption from the State, FEMA will issue an official approval letter stating which  jurisdictions have adopted and are approved and eligible for FEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs. The  approval letter will include the expiration date 5 years from the date of the letter. Attached to the approval letter will  be a final Local Mitigation Plan Review Tool that provides feedback on the strengths of the plan, recommendations  for plan improvements during future plan updates, and suggestions for implementing the mitigation strategy.  ", "1337": "Local Adoption of the Plan Adoption by the local governing body demonstrates the  communitys commitment to implementing the mitigation  strategy and authorizes responsible agencies to execute their  actions. The final plan is not approved until the community  adopts the plan and FEMA receives documentation of formal  adoption by the governing body of the jurisdiction(s)  requesting approval. The governing bodies are typically the  Town Board, City Council, County Commissioners, and/ or Board of Selectmen. While plan adoption usually occurs  through a formal resolution, council minutes, consent agendas,  or other forms of adoption are acceptable if allowed by local  law. Appendix A includes an example of a local adoption  resolution (see Worksheet 8.1).  Each jurisdiction submits documentation of adoption to the State, who is responsible for forwarding this on to the  FEMA Regional Office. If you choose to use the APA process, adoption must take place within 1 year of receipt of  FEMAs APA notification.", "1338": "Multi-Jurisdictional Adoption Each jurisdiction seeking plan approval must adopt the plan. If  you choose to use the APA process, it is important to coordinate  the adoptions of all the jurisdictions as soon as the plan receives  APA status. The governing bodies may have different meeting  schedules, which prevent all the jurisdictions from adopting at  the same time. If possible, coordinate the adoptions and submit  documentation to the State at the same time.

FEMA  will issue an official approval letter stating which jurisdictions have adopted the plan and are eligible for FEMA  hazard mitigation assistance programs. The plan will expire 5 years from the date of FEMAs approval letter for the  mitigation plan. The approval letter and date are generated with the first jurisdiction adopting the plan. The plan  approval date remains the same regardless of when other participating jurisdictions adopt the plan. It is important  to coordinate the adoption process to ensure that all participants are covered by the plan for the full 5 years. Plan  updates follow the same adoption process", "1339": "Additional Considerations Additional considerations related to the plan review and approval process include:  Communicate with your SHMO early and often. Discuss with your SHMO whether it would be appropriate to  share drafts of the plan or portions of the plan prior to a formal review to ensure the plan is complete. Also, you  will want to ensure your plan meets any additional State requirements, which are noted in Element F of the Local  Mitigation Plan Review Tool.  Keep stakeholders informed. The relationships you have already established with stakeholders, elected officials,  and government agencies will be important assets during the adoption process. To facilitate adoption of the plan,  periodically brief community decision makers throughout the planning process on the progress of the planning  teams efforts. When presenting the final draft for adoption, invite the planning team to the meeting and ask  supporting agencies to provide testimony regarding their support of the plan.   Allow for sufficient time. Build time into your planning process to meet State and FEMA procedures for review.  Task 2 describes the development of a scope and schedule for the planning process, which may involve a lengthy  timeframe for review, approval, and adoption. Your local governing body may meet only once a month and may  require agenda items to be submitted well ahead of time.  ", "1340": "Celebrate Success Now that the plan is adopted and approved, the work is just beginning. But first, its time to celebrate! Publicize the  adoption and approval of the plan. Consider getting the word out using multiple methods, such as the following:  Post a notice on the communitys website  Issue a press release on plan adoption and approval to local media outlets  Distribute notices of approval to stakeholders  Announce the first project(s) to be initiated  Propose a congratulatory resolution or achievement award for the planning team (or specific individuals) for  their successful work and commitment to making the community safer These and similar steps are easy to complete, are inexpensive, and will keep the plan at the forefront of peoples  minds, helping to build momentum as you move into implementation. Task 9 provides recommendations for  implementing your mitigation strategy to reduce risk and strengthen your communitys resilience to future disasters. ", "1341": "Use the Post-Disaster Window of Opportunity The post-disaster recovery period offers unique opportunities  to accomplish mitigation goals. Public support and political  will to change policies and invest in long-term risk reduction  may be at its highest. In addition, funding sources may become  available for mitigation, such as FEMAs Hazard Mitigation  Grant Program (HMGP) and Public Assistance (PA) Section 406  funding described in the Funding and Resources section that follows.  A strong mitigation plan can help your community be prepared  to take advantage of the funding and resources. Incorporation  of mitigation strategies into either a pre-disaster or post-disaster  recovery plan reinforces the linkage of long-term risk reduction  and community resilience.  In a post-disaster environment, significant reinvestments  in infrastructure and development are often made during a  relatively short timeframe. The mitigation plan can help guide  those efforts to create a community that is more resilient to  future disasters. Here are some questions to consider and take  full advantage of the post-disaster window of opportunity for mitigation:   How can disaster funds be used to implement actions in the mitigation strategy?   How can the planning team take advantage of the publics risk awareness due to the disaster events?   How can the disaster effects influence future land use decisions to work toward mitigation goals?   What local mitigation capabilities need to be strengthened based on lessons learned?  Post-disaster implementation also presents challenges. Local priorities may be limited to building back quickly,  rather than safely, or communities may face strained capacity or capability as local officials address other post- disaster priorities. Increased mitigation funding and technical assistance from State and Federal sources after a  disaster can help offset these challenges. The recovery process should ensure that mitigation priorities, as outlined in  the plan, are actively applied to reinvestment decisions.  ", "1342": "Focus on Quality over Quantity  As you move forward with transitioning from plan development to plan implementation, it is important to achieve  a few early wins, or successfully complete some initial mitigation actions. These could be low-cost actions that can  be implemented quickly or a single high-priority project. Demonstrating progress can go a long way in gaining the  support needed to implement more complex actions in the future.", "1343": "Encourage Local Champions Successful projects often involve a strong local champion.  Champions are leaders who understand the mitigation vision,  can clearly communicate it, and can engage others to get buy- in. Spreading out the responsibility for mitigation activities to  a variety of champions increases the likelihood of a successful  mitigation program. Enlist the support of external partners  that can provide additional leverage for promoting projects,  including local businesses and other stakeholders.", "1344": "Identify a Mentor Community officials can learn from other communities that  have successfully implemented mitigation actions.

Avoid the often difficult, ad hoc process of post-disaster discovery of new roles, resources, and roadblocks.  Gain support from whole-community partnerships necessary to support individuals, businesses, and organizations.  Improve stakeholder and disaster survivor involvement after the disaster through a definition of outreach resources and two-way communication methods the local government and key organizations will employ.  Maximize Federal, State, private-sector, and nongovernmental dollars through early and more defined local priorities and post-disaster planning activity.  Provide for more rapid and effective access to Federal and State resources through better understanding of funding resources and requirements ahead of time.  Enable local leadership to bring to bear all capability and more easily identify gaps through a coordination structure and defined roles.  Better leverage and apply limited State and nongovernment resources when there is no Federal disaster declaration.  Maximize opportunities to build resilience and risk reduction into all aspects of rebuilding.  Speed identification of local recovery needs and resources and ultimately reduce costs and disruption that result from chaotic, ad hoc, or inefficient allocation of resources.  Improve capability and continuity through pre- identification of when, where, and how the local government will employ and seek support for post-disaster planning, city operations, recovery management, and technical assistance.

Using a step-by-step discussion of the planning process, this guide introduces  principles underlying preparedness and recovery planning, describes topics to be considered as part of the  planning process, and identifies specific organization-building and planning activities. Achieving fundamental recovery preparedness, involves application of six standard planning process steps  as well as several associated key recovery activities. The key activities are intended to serve as additional  considerations that expand on the overarching six planning steps, as illustrated in the graphic below, and  focus more specifically on the challenges and unique partnerships necessary for successful pre-disaster  recovery planning. In the following chapters this guide provides guidance for applying these steps and  activities in a scalable fashion in large to small communities. The planning process introduced and discussed in this guide directly aligns with the process outlined in  Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans: Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 (CPG 101). This guide is  formatted to follow the six steps of CPG 101 and presents six standard planning steps in Chapters 7 through  12 and then presents key recommended activities that are specific to pre-disaster recovery planning efforts.  Figure 1 can help to serve as a basic orienting checklist for preparing for recovery.", "1367": "AUDIENCE The primary target audiences for this guide are local government officials and planners taking an active  role in organizing or managing the development of a recovery plan. Their titles can vary from  community to community but generally include community, economic, urban or emergency  management planners; key departmental staff and officials such as housing departments or authorities; and city managers. Secondary audiences include organizations that represent key stakeholders in the  community, such as disability, cutural, social services or other interest groups. These secondary  audiences might also include local partners who have responsibility, oversight, or authority (formal or  informal) to manage resources, policies, programs, infrastructure, and institutions significant to the  recovery process. Successful planning for recovery requires participation by local government and community leaders,  officials, organizations, and individuals who are able and ready to take responsibility for shaping the  future of their community. Additionally, government and community leaders who are involved in pre- disaster recovery planning should have the ability to encourage participation from all segments of the  community. While this guide is more extensive than that needed for leadership, a key role of the planner  will be to take key materials and concepts in this guide to educate and inspire community leaders to  support the development and implementation of the recovery planning. The tools and resources  accompanying this guide located at www.fema.gov/plan will include an overview for use with  community leadership Regional or county level agencies, councils or commissions may also be a potential audience. This guide  acknowledges that some communities have more capacity and capability to address pre-disaster recovery  preparation than others do. While the primary responsibility for the planning process is at the local level,  emphasis is placed on identifying partners and resource providers able to collaborate with or supplement  local capacity. A regional or multi-jurisdictional effort may be appropriate where resources are more  limited", "1368": "RECOVERY ACTIVITIES ARE LOCALLY DRIVEN First and foremost, recovery planning should be driven by the community. The NDRF emphasizes, as one  of its nine principles, the concept and importance of local leadership and local primacy. Local governments,  businesses, NGOs, and their community members in particular have the primary responsibility for  many recovery decisions, investments, and actions. Therefore, local governments serve in the lead role in  planning for and managing many aspects of community recovery. Local recovery organizational structure  must have a direct nexus with local government. Local input is also needed by State, tribal, and Federal  partners so that they can design programs and policies to meet local needs.11 In some cases, it may be difficult for the community to take on significant responsibility for the recovery  process because of lack of capacity, resources, staff, or other factors. External partners may need to support  recovery planning, outreach, communication, and implementation activities. However, this support must  still be guided by community leaders, the local government, and a broad range of community stakeholders.  Care must be taken to ensure that support is applied where necessary, beginning immediately after disaster  strikes and continuing through challenging redevelopment decisions.", "1369": "DISASTER RECOVERY PLANNING IS A  BROAD, INCLUSIVE PROCESS Preparedness is a shared responsibility, and it is  important that planning be a whole-community  activity involving individuals; businesses; faith-based  and community organizations; nonprofit groups;  schools and academia; media outlets; cultural,  environmental, and recreational organizations; and  all levels of government. Participation of all parts of  the community strengthens the planning process  and facilitates an equitable implementation after  a disaster strikes. Broad participation is especially  important because buy-in from community  members and organizations is strengthened by  an inclusive process. Recovery planning must  also involve stakeholders and elements of local  government not typically involved in emergency  planning, including economic development,  housing advocates and homeless organizations,  insurance companies, lenders, apartment owners  associations, environmental and historic preservation  stakeholders, and many others. Inclusion is necessary  to ensure that all aspects of a community are  considered.", "1370": "As emphasized in the U.S. Department of Justices An ADA Guide for Local  Governments, 14 recovery planning, both before and after a disaster, must  include people with disabilities and others with access and functional  needs from the beginning to prevent delays or exclusion in post-disaster  recovery efforts. For example, affected populations may need to relocate,  and including these stakeholders in pre- and post-disaster planning  processes helps to better integrate their needs into plans and recovery  actions. Maximum efforts should be made to ensure that community  members whose involvement has historically been low are encouraged  to participate. Youth, for example, can often convey the preparedness  message more strongly than others in the community. Emphasis should  also be placed on including seniors, individuals with disabilities, and  others with access and functional needs15; those from religious, racial,  and ethnically diverse backgrounds; and people with limited English  proficiency. To ensure full and meaningful participation, there must  be physical, programmatic, and communication access for all those  potentially affected by a disaster.", "1371": "Partnerships with regional, State, tribal, and Federal agencies and  organizations are important for recovery planning and post-disaster recovery because disasters can stress  even the most prepared or equipped local community, and partnerships offer a multitude of mutually  beneficial resources. Mutual aid agreements between local governments, councils of governments, tribes,  and regional planning entities are one way partnerships can help alleviate the burden of recovery. Others  include technical assistance from universities, financial assistance from NGOs and charitable organizations,  various other assistance from existing long-term recovery groups, and volunteer assistance from Volunteer  Organizations Active in Disasters (VOAD).", "1372": "The planning process should incorporate the results of other applicable planning processes in the  community and region. Hazard mitigation plans, comprehensive plans, housing plans, and other  planning documents can define a wide range of goals for the community and represent shared priorities  of community members. Linking recovery planning to build on the communitys existing plans helps  inform recovery planning efforts and capitalize on past planning efforts so as not to reinvent the wheel.  Additionally, linking recovery planning with other applicable planning processes helps to incorporate  community perspectives. Recovery activities can then in turn be used to inform revisions to the  communitys other plans. Including the whole community in the pre-disaster recovery planning process  means including all sectors of the community. Many existing Federal programs relate to disaster recovery. While many of these programs are voluntary for  communities, the requirements for participation could benefit communities when they develop their pre- disaster recovery plan. For example, the Economic Development Administration requires communities to  produce Community Economic Development Strategies, and the Department of Health and Human Services  has preparedness requirements for communities that relate to disaster recovery. A pre-disaster recovery  planning process would build upon these existing efforts.  Figure 2 outlines the relationship between existing plans, like those mentioned above, and the pre-disaster  recovery plan. In addition, the figure explains how these existing plans and the pre-disaster recovery plan  are used after a disaster to support the development of post-disaster recovery plans, policies, and projects.", "1373": "RECOVERY PLANNING IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH HAZARD MITIGATION A key goal of both hazard mitigation and recovery is increasing resilience, defined in the National Preparedness  Goal as the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due  to emergencies. Although these two activities differ in many respects, this shared objective of increased  resilience allows mitigation and recovery planning to reinforce one another and leverage greater benefits  within the development of plans, and programs or projects. Because both mitigation and recovery planning  can be carried out pre-disaster, there is generally ample time to coordinate activities and promote more  widespread attention to resilience. Recovery planning can support hazard mitigation and resilience building  by providing a post-disaster mechanism for implementation and integration into the roles, processes,  and decisions that occur in the complex recovery environment. Additionally, much of the analysis and  information involved in the development of mitigation plans can be used to inform the pre-disaster  recovery planning effort. (Note that while recovery planning can support hazard mitigation, the intent of  the pre-disaster recovery planning process is not to add to the communitys mitigation plan.) The pre-disaster recovery planning process benefits from and builds on hazard mitigation as:  The mitigation planning process identifies local  hazards, risks, exposure, and vulnerability;  Implementation of mitigation policies and  strategies reduce the likelihood or degree of  disaster-related damage, decreasing demand on  resources post-disaster;   The process identifies potential solutions to  future anticipated community problems; and  Mitigation activities increase public awareness of  the need for disaster preparedness. Pre-disaster planning efforts also increase resilience  by:  Establishing partnerships, organizational  structures, communication resources, and access  to resources that promote a more rapid and  inclusive recovery process;  Describing how hazard mitigation underlies all  considerations for reinvestment;  Laying out a process for implementing activities  that will increase resilience; and  Increasing awareness of resilience as an  important consideration in all community activities.", "1374": "A key goal of both hazard mitigation and recovery is increasing resilience, defined in the National Preparedness  Goal as the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due  to emergencies.", "1375": "RECOVERY PLANNING IS GOAL ORIENTED Thorough, comprehensive, and community-supported pre-disaster recovery plans allow a locality to  more easily and effectively begin the recovery process immediately after a disaster. The development and  documentation of recovery planning goals, including the partnerships necessary to achieve those goals,  help recovery stakeholders understand existing capabilities and gaps. Equally important is the development  of realistic goals. Although a community may have its own resources or partner resources at its disposal,  the resources available to recover effectively are finite. Goal development in both the pre-disaster and  post-disaster environments needs to account for the availability of resources so that they may be leveraged  strategically to achieve desired outcomes. Appendix F includes a template that can be used to document  existing capabilities as they relate to recovery goals and the partnerships and resources in place (or not  currently in place) to achieve those goals.  In addition to determining capability gaps, using a goal-oriented process for pre-disaster recovery planning  helps to build consensus among the involved stakeholders. Establishing common, mutually agreeable,  strategic goals early in the planning process reduces conflicts when the plan is implemented in a post- disaster setting.", "1376": "RECOVERY PLANNING IS SCALABLE Recovery plan components should be scaled to meet both the capacity of the community to manage its own  recovery process and the level of risk the community faces. Communities that have minimal resources to  manage recovery but many vulnerabilities and risks will want to emphasize partnership-building in the  planning process and seek assistance from State or regional bodies. Communities with a high capacity to  manage recovery will want to emphasize local roles and responsibilities in facilitating the recovery process  and may be in a position to develop a robust recovery plan. Pre-disaster recovery plan components such as recovery goals and policies, administrative structure, and  activation of personnel (see Appendix E) will vary depending on the capacity of the community and the  partnerships needed or already in place. Operational guidance included in the pre-disaster recovery plan  should also consider the different phases of disaster management, transition from or coordination with  response coordination structures, and identify times when recovery operations peak and when they begin  to wind down. An example of a scalable recovery system is shown in Figure 3.", "1377": " Designating a point-person for recovery planning (ideally, someone who understands both emergency management and community planning)", "1378": " Identifying vital facilities that, if damaged or destroyed, would have the strongest consequences to the community (e.g., facilities used by the public, facilities that serve critical economic functions)", "1379": " Developing a public engagement strategy that is inclusive of the entire communitys population (this also includes determining the best ways to communicate)", "1380": " Identifying existing recovery stakeholders (local agencies or organizations that would be critical to facilitate the recovery process after a disaster)  Identifying outside partnerships to build resilience (State agencies or other organizations that have resources to support local recovery after a disaster)", "1381": " Identifying training programs that could help build the communitys capacity to plan for recovery (these may include training offered by the State or independent study courses offered by the Emergency Management Institute)", "1382": " Identifying key post-disaster responsibilities of local government and officials, not only for immediate rebuilding, such as permitting requirements, but also for establishing a post-disaster strategy for interim and long-term recovery", "1383": " Developing recovery priorities based on existing plans and initiatives already in place (assessing known planning goals that should be incorporated into recovery planning)", "1384": " Establishing a Local Disaster Recovery Manager (LDRM) position, office, and/or set of functions", "1385": " Conducting a vulnerability analysis (determining not only which facilities are critical, but how vulnerable they are to disaster impacts and why they are vulnerable)  Conducting an assessment of recovery capacity (reviewing resources available to support recovery after a disaster and where there are gaps)", "1386": " Developing and adopting a recovery ordinance (a formal ordinance that describes how the community will undertake the recovery process after a disaster)  Developing a hazard mitigation plan (required by FEMA for most disaster assistance);  Developing a formal, stand-alone pre-disaster recovery plan", "1387": " Formalizing mutual aid agreements with other jurisdictions to support long-term recovery needs", "1388": " Integrating resilience strategies into economic development, housing, infrastructure improvement, historic preservation, health policies, and other regional or community programs and plans", "1389": "RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY A truly holistic recovery process must include activities that support building community resilience and  encouraging sustainable development. This concept can be implemented in recovery planning efforts  through coordination with mitigation planning. Mitigation is a sustained action eliminating or reducing  potential effects of hazards, and mitigation planning attempts to identify those hazards, reduce any impacts  from those hazards, and identify potential solutions. Thus mitigation planning, pre-disaster recovery  planning, and other types of planning have parallel perspectives with overarching recovery goals of:  Increasing the speed of community recovery;  Effectively using resources; and  Increasing opportunities for community betterment that take into account and balance all community populations, needs, and risks. A successful mitigation program and other pre-disaster planning can set the stage for a more sustainable  and resilient community by positioning the community to be able to adapt to changing conditions, identify  future natural and human-related disaster threats and hazards, and withstand and rapidly recover from  disruption due to future emergencies. By addressing potential risks and developing solutions, policies, and  action statements, communities become both more resilient and sustainable.  ", "1390": "Identify Collaborative Recovery Planning Team Representatives Identify collaborative recovery planning team representatives from jurisdiction departments/agencies that  have roles in community planning, development, recovery sectors, and disaster recovery.17 It is important  to impress upon potential participants that the recovery planning process is not intended to be limited  to those typically involved in emergency planning. Local agencies or departments well-positioned to  participate in the collaborative planning team may include:  Stakeholders contribute ideas and recommendations  for recovery.  Local elected or appointed officials  (e.g., Mayor, City/County Manager)  Emergency Management and Public Safety  (Police/Fire/Emergency Medical Services)  Community Planning  Zoning and Building Inspection  Finance and Administration  Floodplain Management  Public Works  Education  Community Development or Redevelopment  Agencies  Economic Development (local and regional)  Environmental Protection  Historic Preservation Boards or Commissions 17For a sample list of representatives and their potential roles, see APAs Planning for Post-Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction (1998), Table 4-1. 15.Pre-Disaster Recovery Planning Guide for Local Governments Page 30  Museums, Cultural Institutions, Libraries, and Archives  Health and Social Services  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Coordinators  Housing  Transportation", "1391": "Identify Key Community Organizations That Should Serve as Planning Partners Developing strong participation and ownership by all parts of the community helps build the resilience  needed for a community to act quickly and in a coordinated fashion following a disaster. Many  organizations that should participate in the planning process will take on key roles working hand-in-hand  with local government or with one another. Planning partners may include NGOs, or business leaders  that work inside or outside of the area covered by the recovery planning process, that have responsibilities  or authority relevant to some aspect of community development, social services, economic development,  business, or disaster recovery, and can assist with data collection or analysis, provide advice on planning,  policy development, or other technical assistance. Many other entities, such as NGOs, advocates for  those with disabilities, housing and homeless advocates, environmental advocates, and business and  community organizations can provide input for policy development and other technical assistance during  the recovery planning process. These organizations also bolster the communitys capacity to recover by  providing additional expertise or other support needed both to plan for and implement recovery activities.  Neighboring communities and governments, neighboring tribes, and regional planning organizations  should also be considered as planning partners.  ", "1392": "Identification of team members should promote the concept of making recovery planning an inclusive  process. It is important to include as planning partners those who serve as advocates for the needs of  children, seniors, those with disabilities and others with access and functional needs, those with limited  English proficiency, and those from historically underserved and culturally sensitive populations. This  ensures that the collaborative recovery planning team includes voices from a wide range of perspectives and  fosters wide-ranging support for both pre-disaster plan development and post-disaster plan implementation.  Examples of organizations that may have a role in supporting recovery efforts include:  Chambers of commerce  Educational and medical institutions  Housing non-profits  Faith-based organizations  Realty organizations / associations of realtors  Power and utility companies/cooperatives and  any operator of critical infrastructure  American Red Cross  Community Development Finance Institution  Independent national, regional, and local social  services delivery agencies  Fraternal organizations  Independent charities  Volunteer recruitment groups  Child-focused non-profits/experts  Private-sector trade associations  Apartment owner associations Organizations that help with donations management  are key partners for short-term recovery.

See your State VOAD contact for information).", "1393": "Define the Scope of Recovery Planning Activities Before any in-depth planning can begin, the planning team must carefully define the geographic area to be  served by recovery preparedness activities. If the community has limited resources, it may be beneficial to  consider a multi-jurisdictional recovery plan that covers multiple towns and cities or is county-wide. This  would be particularly appropriate if the community is covered by a multi-jurisdictional hazard mitigation  plan. Regional or multi-jurisdictional planning can help establish common processes as well as facilitate  mutual aid for longer-term recovery activities. Planners need to consider the current mitigation plans and  hazard information when determining geographic scope. The geographic scope and/or multi-jurisdictional partners may need to be revisited as further hazard analysis  occurs (e.g., hazards cross boundaries, strong economic linkages may be affected). Regardless of multi- jurisdictional planning, local governments, individually, may still need to establish specific roles, policies,  requirements, and legal mechanisms but could do so within the framework of the regional or multi- jurisdictional effort. A recovery plan does not need to be lengthy, and should not duplicate, but rather complement, key  elements of recovery that are already addressed in other planning documents. Care should be taken to  identify which activities will be considered and included in the pre-disaster recovery plan and which  will not. The planning team should determine whether existing community planning documents can be  leveraged or built upon to inform recovery planning. Essential recovery information, such as policies and  requirements that support recovery, operational processes and guidelines, key people and partners and their  recovery roles, and recovery resources, may be documented in the communitys other existing planning  documents. Those elements from other planning documents should be summarized or consolidated in  the pre-disaster recovery plan and referenced appropriately. These plans applicability to recovery should  be identified in the pre-disaster recovery plan. For example, there may be certain hazard mitigation,  development, or housing priorities in other community plans that should be consulted during the recovery  period to guide disaster-specific decisions on these topics. Therefore, the pre-disaster recovery plan should  note the existence of such plans and summarize the information contained in those documents, as well as  suggest how and when those planning documents should be incorporated post-disaster.", "1394": "KEY ACTIVITY TWO: DEVELOP AND  IMPLEMENT A STAKEHOLDER AND  PARTNER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Timeline: Ongoing Key Activity Two, which aligns with Step 1 of  CPG 101, is an ongoing activity. While involving  stakeholders and partners early in the planning  process is important to ensure inclusiveness,  stakeholders and partners involved will likely change  over time. As risks, impacts, consequences, capability  gaps, and capacity are determined, additional partners will need to be identified. It is critical that  stakeholders and partners be continually evaluated and that new partners be identified and included as  needed throughout the planning process.  Using the Core Capabilities is one way to identify stakeholders and partners to engage in the pre-disaster  recovery planning process. Table 2 includes potential partners for each Core Capability. The table is not  intended to be an exhaustive list. While there are many strategies for identifying and engaging new partners, one useful approach is to  build upon existing partnerships with organizations that have already been identified and included in  the planning team. These established partner organizations likely have their own network of contacts and  organizations that provide support, in some fashion, to the recovery organization. This concept is known as  using a network of networks and is illustrated in Figure 8. Although these additional partners might not  traditionally be associated with recovery operations, they could be a vital resource to a community. Define the Scope of Stakeholder Engagement Stakeholders are those who will be involved with the work of the collaborative planning team but do not  directly serve on the team. Generally speaking, stakeholders can be anyone with an interest in the recovery  planning process. They may include local individuals and organizations or those from outside of the  community, at the county, State, or even national level. The list of stakeholders should include those with  community ties that can help with outreach, as well as those with technical knowledge associated with  addressing the key community sectors, including all of the Core Capabilities. Considering the local risk  assessment and identifying structures, facilities, and services in areas potentially affected by a disaster helps  to identify additional stakeholders. Additional stakeholders may be identified by those on the collaborative  planning team, as well as by other sources, such as community advocacy organizations. Stakeholders will be motivated to participate in the planning process for a variety of reasons, and the  collaborative planning team needs to take those reasons into account. Additionally, the planning team will  need to set expectations for stakeholder involvement and define the contribution needed from stakeholders  throughout the process.

Regional, State, tribal, and Federal partnerships are  important because disaster impacts are typically regional and felt by people both inside and outside  of city limits, across county lines, and/or across State lines. External partnerships (partnerships with  organizations, associations, and agencies not already part of the collaborative planning team) facilitate  the sharing of resources across and between jurisdictions and can help compensate for local capability  deficits. Pre-disaster communication and coordination among external partners helps ensure that these  partners are prepared to help the community recover more quickly after a disaster. At the Federal level,  there are numerous examples of external partners that support the RSFs, which can be found in the NDRF.

Additional information  about determining how external agencies align with local agencies and organizations can be found in APAs  Planning for Post-Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction.  Considering how external organizations interact with one another is also important. For example, when  connecting with a State agency, it is important to understand their relationships with other State agencies and  Federal agencies as all of these agencies from all levels of government play a role in post-disaster recovery  efforts.

If the community  has a hazard mitigation plan, risk assessment  information in that document should be used  as a starting point. If a hazard mitigation plan  does not exist, use guidance provided in the Local  Mitigation Planning Handbook, Task Five, to conduct a  risk assessment. In most cases, hazard mitigation  plans address only natural hazards. Planners should  consult other documents, such as Threat and Hazard  Identification and Risk Assessments (THIRAs),22 that  have been completed by States, regions, tribes, and  some communities for additional threat and hazard  information. Other risk assessment documents, such as critical infrastructure assessment plans, and current  conditions of a community should also be considered when identifying a comprehensive list of hazards.  Some planning documents may focus only on short-term impacts. The recovery planning process must  ensure that long-term impacts and consequences are considered. Plans such as regional Comprehensive  Economic Development Strategies23 provide a broader view of risks and consequences.  These existing documents provide detailed information to assist in identifying potential impacts from  threats or hazards. Reviewing these plans helps planners throughout the recovery planning process  to identify threats and hazards, and will also serve as a baseline for determining existing roles and  responsibilities, and existing policy and capability gaps. Examples of existing documents to review and  consider include: 22CPG 201 can also assist in identifying threats or risks that may not be addressed in a local mitigation plan. 23The Economic Development Administration has updated the Community Economic Development Strategies requirements to include a section on resilience and  recovery planning http://restoreyoureconomy.org/recovery/post-disaster-planning-for-economic-recovery/  Know Your Community The key to determining risks, impacts, and  consequences is to know your community and  understand what defines your communitys identity.  Using existing data that may be available in local  planning documents or from local community  organizations, identify and map all community  features, attributes, community makeup, people,  and assets (social, political, financial, infrastructure,  public and private sector, institutional, etc.).  Understanding these community features will assist  the hazard identification process and provide a  more thorough understanding of resources at the  communitys disposal. You should examine previous  disaster events and their impacts and communicate  to the planning team any community insights from  these previous disasters.

Additional capabilities should include formal capabilities from the mitigation  mission area, such as Community Resilience, or capabilities that do not appear in the National Preparedness  Goal (such as individual and family empowerment or volunteer management) but are very important to the  community.  General questions for additional consideration when assessing community capacity include:  What must be done to ensure that the necessary resources to carry out a post-disaster coordination, planning, and management process are identified and available? Are additional partners, technical expertise, funding, or other resources required? How can the community address each of the Recovery Core Capabilities and any additional needs during an actual recovery process?  What are the indicators of successful recovery? How does the community define a successful recovery? For example, would a certain percentage of homes need to be rebuilt or rehabilitated? A certain percentage of businesses or schools? Would stabilized local revenues indicate successful recovery? Is an increased level of resilience or mitigation of risk a priority outcome?  How well do the other elements of local government outside emergency management fully understand the workload, activities, and needs associated with their roles in recovery?", "1412": "Evaluate Planning and Regulatory Strengths and Weaknesses Those involved in the pre-disaster recovery planning process should inventory and review current policies  and regulations that relate to recovery operations or other potential post-disaster community development  activities. Careful consideration is needed to evaluate whether these policies and regulations work to  support, or could potentially hinder, post-disaster recovery. Additionally, policies and regulations that could  potentially conflict with one another should be considered at this point. Documents to consider include: The issuance of building permits is often an area that  challenges the capacity as well as the policies of a  local government after disaster. Be ready with surge  capacity and communicate permitting requirements to  property owners.  Local ordinances (zoning ordinances,  subdivision regulations, building codes, ADA  accessibility guidelines, and others)   Planning documents, such as:   Required local hazard mitigation plan;,   Comprehensive or land use plans   Capital improvements plans   Fixed transportation and para-transit plans   Small area development plans   Emergency preparedness and response  plans Some questions to consider when conducting this  review include:  What current State policies and regulations would encourage or inhibit recovery activities?   Are there financial, staffing, or other constraints that affect the communitys ability to develop or  update policies and regulations?   What local, regional, tribal, or State policy, planning, or intergovernmental conflicts might be  significant in the event of a major disaster? Is the local policy, plan, or coordination process adequate  to address this limitation or does it conflict in a post-disaster environment? Is the magnitude of  possible rebuilding considered in these activities? Policies from other levels of government that may impact local recovery efforts (e.g., State policies) should  be referenced to ensure that local recovery can take place without violating those policies. For example,  some States are Dillon Rule States, whereby local governments can only exercise authority expressly  granted by the State. In the context of pre-disaster recovery planning, communities in Dillon Rule States  need to coordinate with State counterparts to determine responsibilities and authorities post-disaster. If  there is any doubt about the legality of a recovery action such as the development of a recovery ordinance,  local stakeholders should work with their town, city, or county attorney to de-conflict policies and  procedures. ", "1413": "Evaluate Local Organizational and Staff Resources Available  Inevitably, recovery operations create an increased workload for partners. During pre-disaster recovery  planning efforts, it is critical that partner agencies and organizations evaluate their staffing resources.  This evaluation will serve to not only identify gaps in staffing quantity or expertise, but will also identify  strengths and capacities of various partners. For example, expertise related to community development,  housing, community planning, social services, disability access, historic preservation, identifying funding  sources, grant writing, public administration, and financial management are particularly important in  developing a robust pre-disaster recovery plan. Some questions to consider when evaluating staff resources include:   What staffing resources are available to assist with the increased workload associated with recovery activities?  Does current staff have subject matter expertise necessary to undertake recovery activities, develop new programs, or organize complex long-term projects?  Do all city departments fully understand their roles in recovery and redevelopment?  What organizational structures already exist within partner organizations to manage recovery? Are there long-term recovery organizations or committees to coordinate those NGOs supporting individuals and families, to manage volunteers and donations, or to use nontraditional assets? What community leadership is available to lead recovery efforts, within local government and among external organizations?", "1414": "Evaluate Financial Strengths and Weaknesses Recovering from a disaster costs money. Partner agencies and the community as a whole must consider a  communitys normal tax base in conjunction with the post-disaster potential loss of tax base, and increased  government operational costs. The costs of recovery management and activities should be considered as  well. As financial aspects of disaster recovery are evaluated, some questions to consider include:   What current local government and NGO financial resources are available to use for potential recovery activities?  Are contingency plans available for continuity of the operation of local government and/ or NGOs over an extended period of time? Specifically, are mechanisms in place for emergency funding and procurement after a disaster?  Are financial reserves available to address potential risks? What is the ability of the local government and NGOs to apply for grants, establish lines of credit, or secure other funds needed for recovery?", "1415": "Evaluate Communication and Outreach Strengths and Weaknesses As discussed above, effective pre-disaster recovery planning is based on inclusive partnerships and  considerations of the whole community. Communication and outreach strategies are the foundation of  developing inclusive partnerships and taking a holistic approach to both pre- and post-disaster recovery  planning. Pre-disaster, local governments and their partner agencies should identify their plans and  resources available to conduct outreach. Attention should be paid to identify strategies to effectively  communicate with seniors, people with disabilities, people with access and functional needs, people with  religious, racial and ethnically diverse backgrounds, and people with limited English proficiency.  Questions for consideration when evaluating strengths and weaknesses include:  What capabilities does the community have  to involve residents and other stakeholders in  recovery planning?   What capabilities does the community have  to educate residents and other stakeholders  about the importance of recovery planning and  preparedness?   What capabilities does the community have to  communicate with community members after  a disaster and to engage them in coordinated  recovery activities?   What relationships does the community have  with organizations that can assist with recovery  planning and implementation? Information should be collected in an organized manner to help maintain a clear understanding of the  communitys capabilities. To assist with this, a Recovery Capability Documentation Template Worksheet is  provided in Appendix F. Understanding strengths and weaknesses enables the community to determine what  additional partnerships may be required, such as NGOs or other levels of government, to improve strengths  and weaknesses. The information in this section (particularly the identification of resource gaps) will assist  the planning team in identifying new partners to engage. Building partnerships is an ongoing activity that  ought to be regularly revisited to ensure maximum partnership and community engagement in the process.  ", "1416": "Determine Leadership The first major leadership decision that planners and community leadership must make is the identification  of a LDRM. The LDRM, as defined in the NDRF, organizes, coordinates, and advances recovery at the local  level. This position has both pre- and post- disaster responsibilities. The person in this position requires  knowledge of the community, relationships with other local leadership, the ability to pull a team together  to develop a long-range vision, strong communication skills, and knowledge and experience in community  planning. Additionally, an effective LDRM needs to have the following general qualities:   Authority: The ability to direct and execute  recovery. As noted in FEMAs Effective Coordination  of Recovery Resources for State, Tribal, Territorial and  Local Incidents, 27 the LDRM will need to have  the authority and influence to convene and  coordinate recovery stakeholders while  emergency managers continue with disaster  response.28 This requires support from senior  leadership for recovery. The LDRM should be  respected and recognized as a leader across as  many sectors of the community as possible.  Galveston, TX, mayor and city council preside at a city  recovery plan meeting after Hurricane Ike. 27FEMA, Effective Coordination of Recovery Resources for State, Tribal, Territorial, and Local Incidents (2015), https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/ documents/101940. 28Section 2 (Leading the Recovery Coordination Process of Effective Coordination of Recovery Resources for State, Tribal, Territorial and Local Incidents).Pre-Disaster Recovery Planning Guide for Local Governments Page 50  Accountability: Recovery leadership must be accountable to the stakeholders of the community and those that empowered them to manage recovery in the first place.  Attitude: Recovery leadership must understand that recovery is a long-term endeavor involving many stakeholders, each with their own interests, needs, opinions, and resources. Being persistent but patient in working with local stakeholders and other partners is critical to managing the recovery process.  Aptitude: The ability to think strategically over the long-term about recovery needs, the ability to be flexible in using nontraditional approaches and resources, and an understanding about how to leverage resources and bring about stakeholder consensus are all necessary in an effective LDRM. Strong leadership is critical for successful recovery, so the identification of such leadership must be a high  priority. A strong leader makes securing partnerships easier, in part because the community will be able to  demonstrate that it has put time, thought, and talent into preparing for recovery. The LDRM ought to also  have the relationships and expertise necessary to ensure that recovery activities are closely coordinated with  response and mitigation efforts. Partnerships across the various mission areas need to be made long before  a disaster.", "1417": "Develop an Organizational Structure After the LDRM has been selected, planners must  decide which agencies and organizations will serve in  lead roles and which will provide support during the  post-disaster recovery process.  Creation of a recovery management office may be  appropriate depending on the potential complexity of  the recovery or the structure of the city government.  The APA report Planning for Post-Disaster Recovery: Next  Generation provides detailed recommendations (see  pages 5759 of that report) for integrating such an  office that would focus on four objectives:  Offering a foundation for preparation of a  recovery plan that anticipates as clearly as  possible pre- and post-disaster recovery needs,  as well as short- and long-term recovery  requirements  Providing an administrative umbrella for  recovery management under which both  short-term emergency-related and long-term  development-related recovery initiatives can be coordinated  Creating an action-oriented organizational venue for kick-starting effective short-term recovery  initiatives and actions  Coordinating short-term recovery initiatives and actions with visioning, exploration of options, and  public policy making more characterized by long-term recovery for rebuilding. Examples of governmental agencies that may have a role in supporting recovery efforts include the local  planning department, regional planning organizations, environmental and historic preservation offices,  health department, department of economic development, public works, housing and community  development, department of social services, zoning and building code department, the public school  system, and area colleges and universities.30", "1418": "Create Sector-Specific Coordinator Positions In addition to leadership, other positions need to be identified in the recovery organization. These positions  should be coordinators associated with key areas of community recovery. These coordinators may be  drawn from local government staff or other recovery partners. In organizing these key areas, it is helpful  to consider aligning core roles and capabilities with key community needs. In addition to the expertise  required as part of their normal duties, coordinators would also be the primary points of contact for  recovery in that subject area and would provide updates and other situational awareness to the LDRM. The  Core Capabilities, listed below and discussed in detail above, can be used as a framework and modified to  meet the communitys situations both pre- and post-disaster.  The Importance of Drawing on Others  Expertise A local housing expert may understand affordable  and accessible housing and the need for it within  the community (e.g., affordable price ranges and  locations), while the LDRM may not have that specific  knowledge. Officials with specific expertise should  support the LDRM to ensure successful recovery.  Other organizations may also need to support recovery  by assuming leadership roles and representing their  constituents in a way that ensures that the recovery  process is inclusive and community driven.   Operational Coordination (LDRM)  Recovery Planning  Public Information  Economic Recovery  Health and Social Services  Housing Recovery  Infrastructure Systems  Natural and Cultural Resources Beyond the Core Capabilities, other categories for  sector-specific positions could include:  Individual and Family Recovery   Hazard Mitigation and Resilience  Volunteer Coordination  Children and Youth   Accessibility or ADA Coordination When assigning personnel to recovery positions,  it is important to consider and follow local  protocols and procedures; planners must consider  how appointments and assignments of staff must  take place. Recovery committee(s), stakeholder  group(s), and existing task forces or committees  can be used as appropriate when determining the  sector-specific structure that a community will  use. Communities with limited staff may want  to take a regional approach, or look to county or  regional governments for assistance in coordinating  activities.  ", "1419": "Determine Sources of Additional Resources, Technical and Administrative Support Individuals representing different sectors will support the sector-specific coordinators as subject matter  experts in their particular fields. The pre-disaster recovery planning process presents the opportunity to  identify sources of expertise in subjects including recovery planning, resource management, fundraising,  public outreach, partnership engagement, project implementation, and coordination with State, tribal, and  Federal government agencies. The identification, acquisition, and coordination of resources play a significant role in post-disaster  recovery. Resources employed to facilitate recovery may include shared information (such as data,  intelligence, and key stakeholders contacts), technical assistance, subject matter expertise, and funding  mechanisms (such as existing financial reserves, grants, and loans). Planners can also look to the Effective  Coordination of Recovery Resources for State, Tribal, Territorial, and Local Incidents guide for more detailed information  specific to recovery resource identification, management, and coordination. A lack of resource coordination  among recovery participants can lead to conflicts and inefficiencies. After recovery leadership positions and their responsibilities are determined, it is also important to identify  general administrative coordination and planning activities that occur during a recovery process. This is  a prerequisite for all other recovery planning activities and is a key component of a pre-disaster recovery  plan. Some of these administrative activities can be addressed in a recovery ordinance (Appendix D),  discussed in Key Activity Six.", "1420": "Define Recovery Operations Guidelines and Strategies After positions have been determined within the  recovery organization, operating guidelines and  strategies must be established to ensure effective  communication and coordination that will fully  meet the needs of the community. Agencies serving  in lead roles as a sector-specific coordinator need  to work with their respective supporting agencies  and partners to determine their own operational  strategies. Careful consideration of existing  statues, policies, and regulations will be required  during this phase of the planning process. Defined  guidelines and strategies vary from sector-to-sector  and from community-to-community. In a pre- disaster planning process, coming to an agreement  ahead of time about coordination mechanisms and  strategies facilitates more efficient and effective post- disaster activities.", "1421": "Develop a Process for Notifying and Engaging Recovery Partners in Preparation for or Immediately after a Disaster Creating a chain of communication and pre-determined location(s) for convening partners enables  recovery planning and implementation to be initiated in a timely manner. Use of technology for virtual  coordination and information sharing can be considered. Not every emergency will require a robust  recovery organization, which means planners need to take steps in a pre-disaster context to determine  what situations would require the recovery organization to take action. Care should be taken in this step to  clearly delineate responsibility for leading the engagement of recovery partners either in preparation for,  or immediately after a disaster has occurred. These communications must be accessible to partners with  disabilities or access and functional needs to ensure inclusiveness of the whole community.  ", "1422": "Prepare a Process for Gathering Damage Information and Assessing Impacts to Evaluate and Support Recovery Activities  through the Long-Term One of the first post-disaster recovery activities is to assess damage and gather information. While each  disaster impacts a community in a different way, steps can be taken during the pre-disaster planning  process to establish information sharing practices. Emergency managers and responders may be a source of  initial impact information immediately after a disaster has occurred. The full range of partners identified  through the planning process will assist with preparing a broader and longer-term statement of impact  needs. Sector-specific coordinators and other community leaders should identify, pre-disaster, what sorts  of information they need and how best to obtain that information. Consideration must also be given to  data collection mechanisms and long-term impact analysis. Information sharing and analysis processes  should be considered with partners from all sectors to ensure that the products can be used by all partners  involved in the recovery process.  Historic buildings and districts and other cultural  resources should be factored into pre-disaster and  post-disaster priorities.Pre-Disaster Recovery Planning Guide for Local Governments Page 56 Many options exist for information collection, analysis, and sharing; what works for one community may  not work for another. Local governments may also want to consider the use of tools and software to assist  in completing these tasks. While the specific execution of an information gathering and sharing strategy  will likely need to be addressed post-disaster, preliminary decisions can be made pre-disaster in regards to  who is responsible for data management and what partners can provide pertinent community information.", "1423": "Develop Guidelines for Recovery-Related Public Communications Coordinated messaging is a challenge in any  portion of a disaster. In recovery specifically,  information for citizens can be complex, confusing,  and even conflicting. The recovery organization  needs a defined position dedicated to ensuring  that information related to the recovery effort is  being effectively communicated to the public in  accessible formats. Specifically, the planning team  should determine who is responsible for delivering  effective public communication, how this will be  accomplished, how often, in what formats, and  for what purposes. To the extent possible, it is  important to be transparent in informing the public  so that expectations can be identified in advance,  properly addressed, and clarified. Transparency  helps to build public confidence in the recovery effort.  ", "1424": "Develop Strategies for Tracking the Needs of Individuals and Families and Connecting Them with Recovery Support Resources  (Referred to as Disaster Case Management) The primary goal of disaster recovery operations is to address the needs of survivors and communities.  Recovery planners should develop holistic, pre-disaster recovery plans and strategies, based on potential  disaster scenarios, to address both disaster-caused and pre-existing, ongoing social service and community  development needs. These plans and strategies should include a comprehensive disaster case management  process that integrates technological solutions as well as tracks and matches survivors and available  resources, develops individual disaster recovery plans, and provides referrals and advocacy services.  Whole-community recovery includes disaster case management for individual recovery and efforts to  rebuild community infrastructure. Both approaches require strong partnerships among government, local  community, NGO, and private-sector stakeholders and are key for survivor recovery. NGO-led disaster case management has been the cornerstone of recovery for more than 40 years. In 2006,  FEMA was authorized to develop and implement a disaster case management program when Congress  enacted the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, with States including Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey,  and New York implementing disaster case management under FEMA grants. Working under their own  missions, NGOs continue to provide disaster case management services to survivors and training to  practitioners.33", "1425": "Identify Strategies for Securing and Managing Financial Resources  After the evaluation of financial strengths and weaknesses in the previous Key Activity, the planning team  will need to develop strategies for filling identified financing gaps. Financial resources to consider include  both grants and low-interest loans. It is important to be aware that loans may be necessary to support  recovery, especially in cases where grants and similar funds are not available or do not fully support  recovery needs. Financial resources are not only needed for individuals and families, but for businesses  and various sectors of the government as well. Many potential post-disaster funding sources can be pre- identified", "1426": "Identify Strategies and Processes for Engaging with State-Level Recovery Structure and Variety of State, Tribal, and Federal  Agencies Most States have a recovery leadership and coordination structure that addresses the recovery Core  Capabilities. Some States may have a structure that includes a function for assistance to and outreach to local  recovery entities and organizations. During pre-disaster recovery planning, the mechanism for coordinating  with external partners, such as State government agencies and departments, and Federal resources, should  be identified. Local governments may elect to have a position within the local recovery organization that  works directly with the State or may choose to have State and local resources that work in similar functional  areas collaborate directly. The pre-disaster recovery plan should also identify existing relationships between  local departments and State and Federal agencies, and ought to identify strategies for leveraging and  coordinating those relationships in a post-disaster environment. These relationships, as well as the strategies  for engagement that are identified pre-disaster vary greatly among local communities.  ", "1427": "KEY ACTIVITY SIX: ESTABLISH PROCESSES FOR POST-DISASTER DECISION-MAKING  AND POLICY SETTING Timeline: Months 3 to 9 In addition to establishing an effective organizational structure with all of the necessary agencies and  partners, stakeholders and participants in recovery must also establish leadership principles and a decision- making process. Similar to Key Activity Five, the decisions that relate to post-disaster decision-making  processes and priority-setting should be made using CPG 101 Step 4 as a guide. With likely threats and hazards in mind, the pre-disaster recovery planning team will need to determine  what goals, priorities, and policies can be established prior to a potential disaster. While priorities for  short-, intermediate-, and long-term recovery established pre-disaster are ideal in helping to facilitate and  inform post-disaster decision-making, the impacts of a disaster vary, and therefore some decisions, policies,  and procedures will be made in the midst of the recovery process. For example, understanding that much  of the community is in a flood zone allows local officials to begin thinking about a relocation plan. The  considerations and decisions related to recovery from a flood are very different from the decisions made in  the wake of an earthquake. However, in both cases, if baseline priorities for leadership addressing short-,  intermediate-, and long-term recovery have been established pre-disaster, the outcomes for the impacted  community will be improved.  Planners must determine a process for making decisions post-disaster. As recovery needs are identified,  there must be a process for making decisions to address those needs. Establishing this decision-making  process guides leadership in allocating limited resources. As the decision-making process is developed  during this Key Activity, it will be helpful to organize decisions through a process that:  Evaluates the conditions and needs after a disaster  Sets recovery goals and objectives  Measures progress against those goals and objectives as well as the process, protocol, and policy concerning recovery funding  Ensures there is sufficient input on recovery priorities from key stakeholders and makes sure that stakeholder outreach is linked to post-disaster decision-making (i.e., the process to involve key stakeholders pre-disaster is reflected in the post-disaster process) The processes for enacting post-disaster recovery policies or ordinances should also be established during  pre-disaster recovery planning. Even before a disaster, a person with the responsibility for enacting policies  (including considerations for when policies ought to be enacted and for how long) can be identified.  Disaster recovery may require that certain authorities and policies be in place to initiate and expedite  recovery activities. This helps to compensate for losses in government capacity or significant challenges and  choices after a disaster.  ", "1428": "The planning team must determine which policies may need to be altered post-disaster to address recovery  needs. Examples of potential policies include expedited zoning and building code compliance review for  rebuilding and expedited procurement or hiring policies. Ordinance language can then be developed to  implement these policies. When drafting policy language, it is important to consider State statutory laws  or authorities that may invalidate or limit the proposed changes. It is also essential to understand the  local governments post-disaster responsibilities under an adopted Floodplain Management Ordinance for  communities participating in the NFIP. Roles and responsibilities for those who would be responsible for overseeing these policies also need to  be established pre-disaster. For example, local governments need to determine who would be responsible  for overseeing expediting zoning review and what authorities they must be granted to accomplish their  assignments. Policies should be drafted to ensure that recovery participants will have the authority needed  to execute their responsibilities. Formalizing authority legitimizes the pre-disaster recovery plan and  indicates commitment by local leadership. Authority and responsibility of designated recovery leaders  should also be clearly defined. This step can be accomplished by developing a recovery ordinance, which  grants the recovery organization the authority to implement recovery planning activities after a disaster  strikes. For more information about how to develop an ordinance, see Appendix D of this guide. Finally, formal approval must be obtained by the governing body for policies and ordinances that have been  developed. Proposed ordinances and the recovery plan can be adopted by the jurisdiction at the same time.", "1429": "KEY ACTIVITY SEVEN: WRITE THE LOCAL PRE-DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN Timeline: Months 6 to 10 Aligning with CPG 101 Step 5, information,  documentation, and decisions from the preceding  Key Activities should be consolidated to formulate  a written local recovery plan. CPG 101 includes  general guidelines for writing effective plans. The  plan must be concise and clearly communicate  the decisions made by the pre-disaster recovery  planning team to operators, partners, and the  public in an accessible format. The plan ultimately  provides a framework for action, accounting for  known pre-disaster issues and resource gaps, and  addresses leadership, partners, priorities, and  polices for recovery.

Further explanation regarding these components is  provided in Appendix E.", "1430": "KEY ACTIVITY EIGHT: APPROVE THE PRE-DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN AND  ASSOCIATED REGULATIONS Timeline: Months 8 to 12 Community members should be invited to review and provide feedback ahead of final approval and  publication of the plan. This activity aligns with Step 5 of CPG 101. Public outreach may be accomplished  through a variety of means, including advertising through traditional media outlets, such as newspapers  and radio, and through other nontraditional outreach, including organizational bulletins and social media  websites, such as Facebook and Twitter. Many communities have used social media as one means of public outreach. While there may be a legal  obligation to use traditional media, supplementing those kinds of outreach efforts with nontraditional  outlets helps ensure that the overall outreach effort is as inclusive as possible. The plan should be made  available by various means (including printed and electronic versions) and in formats accessible to  those with communication access needs. A short summary of the plan and/or plan topics should also be  developed as the plan is finalized to serve as a quick reference. Notification to the community about this review process may include traditional means, including print  media, as well as nontraditional means, such as social media or other online forums. Public outreach  should be used to determine accessibility needs. Furthermore, planners must be sure to consider the use  of appropriate auxiliary aids and services (e.g., interpreters, captioning, alternate format). It is critical, as  part of this outreach effort, to include representation from the whole community, including children;  individuals with disabilities and others with access and functional needs; those from religious, racial, and  ethnically diverse backgrounds; and people with limited English proficiency.", "1431": "KEY ACTIVITY NINE: IDENTIFY ONGOING PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES  Timeline: Ongoing Ongoing activities such as training, exercises, and document revisions ensure that local stakeholders are  able to effectively undertake post-disaster recovery activities. The final Key Activity (which aligns with Step  6 of CPG 101) is vital to ensure that the plan remains a useful document for the community and to ensure  that stakeholders are prepared to implement the plan if necessary.  Establish Which Agency or Committee is Responsible for Overseeing Ongoing Preparedness Activities Having collaborative recovery planning team members oversee ongoing activities provides a stable and  consistent means for enabling the communitys continuous understanding of the recovery plans and the  steps and resources available to follow the plan. Adopting formal procedures and policies to govern ongoing  preparedness activities will provide a framework for standardization of and consistency in subsequent  recovery actions undertaken. Ideally, one of the agencies on the planning team is designated to manage and  monitor preparedness activities related to the plan.  Undertake Regular Activities to Increase Preparedness To maximize understanding and build capacity in the recovery process, communities should establish  a regular schedule of training, exercises, and document review, revision, and update. This will enable  planners to address outstanding capability or process gaps, mitigation needs, and other preparedness needs.  Recovery planfocused exercises should be integrated into other community preparedness activities. The  recovery plan should be discussed along with any activity associated with other planning projects that  already have built-in public involvement, such as the comprehensive plan, hazard mitigation plan, or  economic development strategies. Additionally, considerations for recovery operations (guided by the pre- disaster recovery plan) should be included in exercises of the emergency response plans for the community.", "1432": "Test Pre-Disaster Planning, Preparation, and Staff Capabilities through Recovery Exercises Recovery exercises are drills used to test execution of recovery operations. Exercises involve developing  hypothetical disaster scenarios and asking the recovery organization and other partners to consider the  community ability to implement recovery under those circumstances. This process enables evaluation of  the plan, aides the community in understanding its role in recovery preparedness and plan implementation,  and helps identify gaps in policies, roles, partners, resources, and procedures. When testing the pre-disaster recovery plan, it is important to consider unanticipated challenges that could  hamper the community while addressing a disaster. For example:  The building permit office does not have enough staff to manage the increased permitting workload. How will the locality increase the permitting capacity to meet post-disaster demands and support rebuilding efforts?  The fire chief has been asked to take the lead role in overseeing the pre-disaster recovery planning process and establish new partners for redevelopment. Does the fire chief have the authority and capability to do that?", "1433": "Conduct Regular Reviews of Pre-Disaster Recovery Plans, Policy Documents, and Ordinances As a communitys population, economic base, leadership, and demographics shift, local capabilities and  capacity may change, it is important to periodically take stock of the communitys capabilities and capacity  to support recovery. This may include new or previously ignored assets and capabilities that may come with  those shifts. This reevaluation may occur in conjunction with other planning updates, such as:  The comprehensive planning process involves evaluating changes in local demographics, the economy, and other local conditions, which pre-disaster recovery planning should take into account.  Local mitigation plans are required to be reviewed and updated at least once every 5 years; updating the pre-disaster recovery plan on the same schedule allows it to include up-to-date risk assessment information. Stakeholders, partners, and the public should be regularly invited to comment on the plan, provide their  concerns and suggestions for revision/updates, and participate in exercises. Regular evaluation and review may require a process for the receipt of notifications of necessary or  proposed changes with respect to other State, county, and/or local statutes, rules and regulations. This may  also include notifications of proposed and effected budgetary changes to agencies and programs that are a  part of the plan.", "1434": "Evaluate New Vulnerabilities Characteristics of a community may change  over time, which means that planners must  regularly reevaluate the threats, hazards, and  vulnerabilities of their community. Vulnerabilities  could be physical, environmental, cultural, or  geographic elements of a community that could  be risk prone, or policies that could inhibit the  ability of a community to recover from a disaster.  They could also be the result of a new hazard or  new information about an existing hazard. Pre- disaster recovery planners need to work closely,  and regularly, with hazard mitigation experts to  research and understand changing community  vulnerabilities. Hazard mitigation is a fundamental  cornerstone of preparedness, and opportunities  to mitigate should be considered and utilized.  Planners must also consider new community  vulnerabilities that arise from changes in policy at  the local, State, tribal, and Federal levels that could  impact the pre-disaster recovery plan. Regardless of  how new vulnerabilities are identified, many of the  previous Key Activities will need to be repeated to  ensure the validity of any decisions that were made  during the planning process.", "1435": "Document Best Practices and Lessons Learned  As the final activity in developing a pre-disaster  recovery plan, the collaborative planning team  should document the steps that were followed in  the planning process. No two jurisdictions conduct  their planning process in exactly the same way, so it  is important that planners take the time to document  best practices and lessons learned. Analysis of the  planning process and defined areas for improvement  in future planning efforts benefit the community  and partner communities as well. Lessons learned  from the planning process, or from execution of  the plan post-disaster should also be used to guide  future revisions of the pre-disaster plan.  ", "1436": "With growing costs and disruptions from natural, technological, and human-caused hazards, many communities are  placing higher priority on understanding and mitigating their vulnerability to, and increasing their ability to recover from,  these hazards. They also need to manage their resources and ability to address these issues while considering other  pressing demands. A resilient built environment can:  Result in less physical, economic, environmental, and social damage and impact;  Support a fuller, more robust, speedier recovery;  Preserve and enhance community functions, such as health and education;  Require less time and money to be spent on relief efforts and repairs; and  Promote co-benefits, such as a livable, walkable community connected to the natural environment.  All communities can improve their resilience and capacity to protect lives, livelihoods, and the quality of life for their  residents and businesses. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Community Resilience Planning  Guide for Buildings and Infrastructure Systems (Guide) recognizes that communities must prioritize their limited  resources and that improving resilience is a process achieved over time. The Guides planning process provides a structured yet flexible way to set community-scale goals, align priorities and  resources, identify key stakeholders, and develop plans for recovery of community functions. Community resilience  planning can inform and integrate other community plans and also reduce conflicting goals between plans.", "1437": "WHAT IS COMMUNITY RESILIENCE? WHY DOES IT MATTER? Community resilience is the ability of a community to prepare for anticipated hazards, adapt to changing  conditions, and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions.  Residents rely on buildings and infrastructure systems for many functions and services that support the activities  of daily living and that underpin the social and economic fabric of their community. By planning, prioritizing, and  acting, communities can improve their resilience over time, in a cost-effective manner that is consistent with their  long-term resilience goals. If a disruptive event does occur, communities with resilience plans will be ready to respond, recover, and build  back better  if rebuilding is necessary. Communities that plan and carry out resilience strategies will be better prepared for future events, making the  community more attractive to businesses and residents alike.", "1438": "This Playbook is intended to help communities  more easily use the Guide and improve community  resilience planning by addressing:  The importance of connecting social and  economic goals and services to the built  environment (i.e., buildings and infrastructure  systems or community lifelines).  The interdependencies of social and economic  functions with the built environment.  The value and practical ways of planning  for recovery  in addition to preparedness,  design, mitigation, and emergency response.  The benefits of a community-scale view of  resilience.", "1439": "BASICS ABOUT THE NIST GUIDE The NIST Guide is based on the experience and  expertise of community officials who have led  planning for and responses to hazard events, as well  as technical experts actively engaged in improving  resilience across the country. The Guide encourages  community leaders  government, private sector,  and individuals  as well as community stakeholders  to think more holistically and systematically  about community resilience and the role of the  built environment. It offers an approach to help  communities integrate all of their community plans  through community resilience planning and goals. The Guide emphasizes the importance of  interdependencies across the built environment,  which includes buildings and infrastructure systems   especially those providing transportation, energy,  communications, and water and wastewater services. The built environment supports vital social and economic  functions such as shelter, food, education, healthcare, business and government. Community services and functions  need to recover as quickly as possible, preferably within a specified period of time set by each community.  When recovery of key services and functions is delayed, community residents  face increasing challenges to remaining in the community. Residents may ask  questions like:  Is the hospital in full operation, especially for emergencies?  Are the roads open for schools and businesses?  Can I get food from the supermarket and cash from the ATM? ", "1440": "The Guide applies to many types of hazard events and to large or small, urban or rural communities. There are many  reasons for communities to start or improve their resilience planning, which the Guide can assist with, such as:  To help them prioritize their use of limited resources as they make resilience-focused investments and  administrative decisions.  To more ably recover from hazard events by thinking through their goals, priorities, and current strengths and  vulnerabilities, and asking informed questions.  To accrue benefits of new investments and improvements in community spaces and infrastructure, even if a  hazard event does not occur in the near future.  To take advantage of the fact that resilience planning is most effective prior to a hazard event.  To integrate well-developed resilience goals into other planning documents so that they will be better  positioned to address opportunities to advance their resilience goals.  To improve eligibility for funding from federal agencies (e.g., FEMA, HUD, EDA) and other sources.", "1441": "mprovements to community resilience do not occur  overnight and some priorities could take years or  decades to fully be achieved. Still, meaningful progress  can be made in shorter time frames. And there are  always low-hanging options that can be considered  once a community agrees on goals and directions.  Thats especially true if community resilience goals are  integrated into all community plans.  The Guide encourages users to obtain input and support  from public and private community stakeholders   local government as well as individuals, community  organizations, and service providers  to address  recovery as well as hazard preparedness, response,  mitigation, and adaptation goals. The Guide also helps  communities review their current situation, including  threats and vulnerabilities, and to identify performance  goals and gaps in the performance of buildings and  infrastructure. Then it assists communities in prioritizing  and addressing those gaps through resilience goals and  planning at the community scale.  All communities are encouraged to conduct the  first three steps in the Guide. That will enable them  to advance beyond the status quo by bringing key  stakeholders together (Step 1), characterizing the  communitys current social and economic needs as  well as its built environment (Step 2), and generating  performance goals and gaps for building clusters  to meet community functions and services (Step 3).  Just asking the questions and considering the issues  necessary to get to this point in the process can prove  useful for communities exploring or embarking on the  Guides process. The Guide process has two types of performance that  are evaluated for buildings and infrastructure systems: desired performance goals and anticipated performance.  Desired performance goals are specified by the community in terms of time to recover functions for systems that  are essential to the community and its recovery. It is important to note that desired performance goals are hazard  agnostic because the need for community services and functions does not vary by hazard event. The anticipated  performance is an assessment of the time to recover function performance expected for existing community systems  if a hazard event occurred tomorrow. The difference between the desired performance (for all hazard events being  considered) and the anticipated performance (for specified hazard events) identifies gaps that can negatively affect  community recovery and long-term resilience. Step 4 helps turn a communitys enhanced understanding of how its social and economic functions rely upon the  built environment and its interdependencies into a plan for moving ahead. After completing step 4, communities are  strongly encouraged to move on to Step 5 (Plan Preparation, Review and Approval) and Step 6 (Plan Implementation  and Maintenance). Details can be seen in the sections that follow each of the 6 steps and via associated links to  worksheet templates (online) and the full Guide.", "1442": "PLAYBOOK USE AND APPLICATION This Playbook provides a practical, action-oriented aid to help communities follow the Guides six-step process. It  can assist communities seeking insights into resilience planning issues and help identify the most effective resilience- COMMUNITY RESILIENCE & HAZARD  MITIGATION PLANNING  As of March 2020, 25,300 local jurisdictions in the U.S.  have developed hazard mitigation plans to reduce risk  from natural hazards and to ensure their eligibility for  FEMAs Hazard Mitigation Assistance Grant Program.  Hazard mitigation is considered to be sustained action  taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to human  life and property from hazards. The range of actions in  hazard mitigation plans are similar to and complement  those addressed in local plans and regulations that  influence land use and development patterns, structure  and infrastructure projects, natural systems protection,  and education and awareness programs. Communities  may use their hazard mitigation plan as a starting point  for developing a community resilience plan. Planning for community resilience emphasizes  connecting mitigation and recovery phases  of preparedness, but also includes response,  protection, and prevention. Community resilience  involves understanding how communities and their  members social and economic activities rely on the  interconnected elements of the built environment and  ensuring the communitys goals for recovery of function  of social and economic activities drive the prioritization  and selection of risk-reducing activities. These activities  span a range of constructed and administrative  solutions (including those within a hazard mitigation  plan). The process of developing hazard mitigation and  community resilience plans are complementary.7 Useful Resources NIST Community Resilience Group website: https://www.nist.gov/topics/community-resilience NIST Community Resilience Planning Guide: https://www.nist.gov/topics/community-resilience/planning- guide NIST Community Resilience Planning Guide Brochure: https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/04/03/ nist_community_resilience_12_page_brochure.pdf Guide Brief 7 - Guide Use by All Community Types: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.

Communities can make use of any of  the six steps in any order that makes  sense to them.  Some communities, for example, may  already be on Steps 2 or 3.  However, reviewing Step 1 might help  them to identify and add important  players to their planning efforts.  This will help develop a more complete  plan through broader community input  and increase the chances of successful  implementation of the plan. improvement projects. It also helps align community plans with  resilience goals when seeking funds to support resilience activities.  The Playbook can be used without expert assistance but also offers  ways to engage experts in the planning and implementation stages.  This Playbook is designed to be a companion document to the  Guide, with a focus on actions to accomplish in each step; it  identifies the key concepts and approaches of the Guide. It can be  especially useful for communities that wish to address only several  of the steps  or simply to introduce the concept of the Guides  planning process and the interdependencies of buildings and  physical infrastructure systems.  This Playbook is intended for communities of any size, at any stage  of resilience planning, and a range of stakeholders:  Elected or career officials in the public sector ranging  from Emergency Services, Public Works, Water and  Wastewater, Planning, Budgeting, Sustainability, and Citizen  Engagement.  Private sector businesses and industry including manufacturers as well as service providers and users.  Non-profits and individuals, including volunteers.  Generalists and technical experts, including consultants assisting communities with resilience planning  and infrastructure projects", "1443": "PARTNERING FOR SUCCESS Local government is the logical convener of community resilience planning initiatives, although stakeholders and  champions may come from other non-governmental organizations or regional government groups. The most effective  resilience planning efforts are championed by a collaborative planning team that provides leadership throughout the  process and engages stakeholders and the broader community. There are many ways to design and operate a planning team. Team representatives should reflect the composition,  culture, and range of planning topics in their communities, including recent, ongoing, or planned initiatives that relate  to resilience. The planning team should consist of local representatives who understand the value of community resilience planning,  are committed to the process, and are able to champion resilience and engage the relevant stakeholders.  Beyond the planning team, public and private owners and operators of buildings and infrastructure systems, leaders  of organizations, and community members should be aware of the resilience planning effort. They may be involved as  advisors or help with specific tasks.", "1444": "COMMUNITY RESILIENCE LEADER Action 1-1: Identify a resilience leader for the community. A resilience leader is typically  identified by the local governing authority or body to promote and coordinate community  resilience. A resilience leader serves as the community official for resilience efforts and coordination with elected community  leaders and key community stakeholders. Identification and recruitment of a collaborative planning team begins  with a resilience leader who directs the process, provides continuity, elevates the importance of resilience, convenes  stakeholders, communicates effectively, and engages public support. A community resilience leader may be a Chief  Resilience Officer (CRO), sustainability office head, emergency management professional, city planner, or other official  with qualifications to advance community resilience.", "1445": "FORMING THE COLLABORATIVE PLANNING TEAM Action 1-2: Identify collaborative planning team members and their respective roles  and responsibilities. Key public and private stakeholders should be identified who represent  community interests on the core and broadened planning teams, with defined roles,  responsibilities, and expectations for serving on the team. There are multiple options for collaborative planning team members, and the composition of community interests  and representative stakeholders will vary by community. A team that encompasses key decision-makers, community  leaders, and stakeholders across the public, non-profit, and private domains is more likely to develop a community  resilience plan that reflects the interests and needs of all stakeholders and will be supported for implementation.  A diverse team can strategically engage relevant community stakeholders who have an interest in or impact on  resilience planning efforts.

The core collaborative planning team should have key representatives for local government functions  such as: community planning, economic development, public works, engineering, emergency services,  building and permitting, health and human services, housing, education, and sustainability. A core team can  promote an efficient launch and develop an outline or draft of the proposed scope of the resilience effort.  The core team can also identify others who should be brought onboard to form the broadened collaborative  planning team and stakeholders who should be kept informed or made partners during the process.  ", "1448": "3. The broadened collaborative planning team may include external stakeholders who can contribute to  community resilience, such as county, state, or federal agencies that manage facilities or infrastructure in the  community or provide funding for resilience plans and projects.

Additionally,  consultants or universities with special expertise, such as meteorological and climate trends or social  vulnerabilities, may provide input.", "1449": "4. The engaged community includes agencies, organizations, and groups not represented on the planning  team that still need to be informed of progress and/or consulted for input on options and proposals. Although  often not part of the planning team, the engaged community should be included from the start of the planning  process.

Deciding on the scope of the resilience  planning effort will play a big role in determining its success. Determining the scope of the community resilience plan is key to defining success and setting expectations for  community engagement and implementation of the plan  and ensures adequate representation on the planning  team. The scope should consider factors such as what elements of the built environment will be included (e.g.,  government buildings and facilities, privately owned facilities) and associated stakeholders, and social and economic  functions supported by the selected infrastructure. It also should take into account the users or stakeholders who rely  on the services provided by these facilities. Considerations for the planning team could include:  Prevailing hazards and chronic stressors. A FEMA hazard mitigation plan approach may provide a list of  natural hazards for consideration. The team can leverage the information from the FEMA-approved mitigation  plan and should decide whether it will address one or multiple prevailing hazards, or perhaps chronic stressors  like increasing temperatures. The team may determine that certain hazards are out of scope because they  are unlikely or because their potential impact might be so great that they are impractical to plan for from the  standpoint of recovery.   The elements of the built environment. The team may decide to address government-owned buildings  for the first phase of its resilience planning effort. Considering this smaller subset may be easier for the team,  but there are trade-offs  including the more limited view of resilience and implications for the communitys  ability to deal with and recover from a hazard event. The planning team should consider if privately owned  and managed elements of the built environment (e.g., electrical infrastructure) should be included to ensure  relevant private sector organizations input are solicited (related to Action 1-4). In any case, if a community is  conducting resilience planning while updating their hazard mitigation plan for FEMA, they may need to include  all buildings and infrastructure systems deemed critical by the community.   Concurrent updates of community plans. There are benefits in explicitly coordinating resilience  planning with other planning efforts involving or led by the community  for example, comprehensive plans,  economic development plans, emergency management plans, and continuity of operations plans, as well as  sustainability or transportation planning efforts.  ", "1459": "ENGAGING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS Action 1-4: Identify key public and private stakeholders. The collaborative planning team  should identify key stakeholders of public and private organizations, including infrastructure  owners and operators and utility service providers. When the planning team collaborates with public and private stakeholders, it improves understanding of the  communitys situation, gains community support for goals, identifies gaps and inconsistencies, and provides  information for prioritizing solutions.

Additionally, stakeholders will be able to  make informed decisions on the operation, maintenance, upgrade, and replacement of their systems in accordance  with community resilience plans and their business objectives. Considerations for engaging community stakeholders include:  Support of key stakeholders: Socialize resilience plans in the community and with centers of community  influence (government and private sector) to build support and understanding before publicly initiating the  planning effort. Dont surprise anyone!  Continuous community engagement: Continuous and active community outreach and engagement   via workshops, briefings, collaborative online dialogues and tools, or focus groups  should be conducted  throughout the planning and implementation process.  Coordinator for community engagement: Appointing a team member to coordinate stakeholder  engagement will help ensure representative inclusion of varied views. External or public affairs officers may be  well positioned to serve in this role.  Data management and sharing: When needed, a cooperative arrangement with private stakeholders  that addresses concerns about information exchange and security for resilience planning can improve  collaboration and access to critical information.  Other resilience perspectives: Infrastructure stakeholders (e.g., communications, power, transportation,  water and wastewater) may need to address resilience from a regional perspective of services and  requirements from federal or state regulations", "1460": "Non-Governmental Organizations  (NGOs) Brings members concerns to governments, advocates for and monitors policies, and  encourages participation in resilience-related efforts.

The planning team should gather existing  community planning documents and review their scope, goals and objectives, timeframes, and  actions that relate to community resilience. The team also should consider upcoming planning  initiatives. In order to conduct effective resilience planning, a community needs a solid understanding of its population, social  and economic functions and institutions, and their dependence on buildings and infrastructure, particularly in times of  disruption due to hazard events. The actions in this step can promote a comprehensive understanding of community  characteristics, needs, and vulnerabilities. Most communities have multiple planning documents that incorporate their views of the future and drive priorities.  These plans can provide a base set of information to identify opportunities to improve community resilience.  Documents may include comprehensive plans, general plans, land use plans, economic development plans, hazard  mitigation plans, local pre-disaster recovery plans, sustainability plans, etc. Assessing these documents through a  resilience perspective will help the team to better understand the full range of community needs, priorities, and gaps,  as well as identify conflicts between plans. It can also be useful to identify when the plans will next be updated, as  updates are good opportunities to incorporate resilience goals into plans. Assessing existing plans helps stakeholders to understand that community plans need to be integrated and that  they may impact one another through unintended conflicts or gaps. For example, when Fort Collins, CO, began its  work, the planning team identified 27 plans produced by the city. All were reviewed to understand the citys long-term  goals for development and inform the resilience planning process using the Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard  (PIRS) method. Continuity of operations plans were included in the review to understand the desired performance  for covered facilities if a hazard event were to happen. In Nashua, NH, the team reviewed all relevant policies and  recommendations found in over 50 community plans. This process also identifies information already collected that  can be used in later steps.", "1464": "HARACTERIZE THE COMMUNITYS SOCIAL DIMENSIONS  The collaborative planning team should assess the communitys social institutions and built environment, focusing  on their role and importance in resilience in the face of hazard events. They should consider different kinds of  vulnerabilities and the needs of the entire population  remembering that all parts of the community are likely  vulnerable in some ways. This helps the team to spot potential gaps in services, as well as to link vital services to  relevant infrastructure and buildings. Template 1-1, Table 1-5 suggests potential members of a social dimensions task  group.  RESILIENCE SCORECARD HELPS COMMUNITIES INTEGRATE PLANS (ACTION 2-1) The Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard (PIRS) method is helping communities to integrate all their plans   like those for transportation, parks, economic development, hazard mitigation, emergency management and  comprehensive land use  so that the plans work together to reduce vulnerability to hazards. For instance, a  citys hazard mitigation plan may call for acquisitions and buy-outs in high-hazard areas, while its comprehensive  land use plan may set goals to increase investments in the same location. Such plans are not only incompatible,  but actively increase vulnerability. PIRS, developed by the Institute for Sustainable Communities at Texas A&M  University, walks users through a process that (1) evaluates community plans with respect to hazard risk and  how well they target areas of the community that are most vulnerable, (2) identifies when and where those plans  are in conflict, and (3) resolves those conflicts across plans to reduce hazard vulnerability.17 Actions 2-2 to 2-5 describe the steps of information collection necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding  of the connection between the communitys social dimensions and its built environment.", "1465": "Action 2-2: Characterize community members and their needs. The planning team should  collect information that provides a data-informed perspective on the communitys population and  contextual factors, including demographic, social, and economic factors that are important to  the communitys residents, organizations, and businesses. Community members present and future needs can be informed with data on population demographics, economic  indicators, social vulnerabilities, and social capital. Demographic information can include age, health, education,  income, employment, housing status, language, cultural background, and vulnerable populations (e.g., those with  medical needs, low income households, non-English speaking populations, and individuals with limited mobility). Links  for publicly available data to characterize the population are listed in Guide Brief 1  Characterize the Population.  Understanding a communitys vulnerable populations needs, expectations, and reliance upon various community  social functions leads to a more inclusive, comprehensive, and respectful resilience planning process. Communities  should determine the needs of its most vulnerable populations, including those who may be underrepresented in  government decision-making organizations, and ensure their perspectives and needs are reflected in resilience efforts  and projects. This information will be especially useful in Step 4  Plan Development. These vulnerable populations  may have differing needs and require unique solutions.", "1466": "Data and input on community demographics and needs may be obtained from research centers, chambers of  commerce, regional planning organizations, consulting firms, institutes of higher learning, faith-based institutions, and  other organizations with data and/or analysis capabilities. Carrying out this step may call for assistance from local  and regional entities, such as city or county planning departments, that have expertise accessing, providing, and  interpreting social and economic data. Census data can be very helpful as well. The planning team may also find it helpful to invite individuals with this expertise to serve as formal members of the  social dimensions task group. Local colleges or universities can be ideal contributors or provide referrals.", "1467": "Action 2-3: Characterize the community social functions and dependencies. The planning  team should inventory and describe the various social dimensions of the community and  the functions provided for residents, including vital services, important social and economic  institutions, and characteristics that make the community desirable to residents and businesses. Identifying social functions and dependencies, as well as key contacts or representatives who can provide information  about social and economic institutions and decision making, is essential. Social functions address the needs of  individuals and social institutions, such as government, health care, manufacturers, retail and service businesses,  faith-based and nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, day care centers, finance, and news media. Much of  the information may already be contained in existing planning documents.", "1468": "CHARACTERIZE THE COMMUNITYS BUILT ENVIRONMENT Action 2-4: Characterize the built environment. The planning team should characterize the  built environment  buildings and infrastructure systems  that community services and functions  rely upon. Dependencies between buildings and infrastructure systems should also be identified. A communitys built environment is foundational to community functions, services, and the variety of daily activities of  its residents. The built environment includes, but is not limited to:   Buildings (e.g., critical, commercial, industrial, residential)   Transportation facilities (e.g., roads, tunnels, rail, airports, maritime ports)  Energy systems (e.g., electric power, fuel systems)   Communication systems (e.g., internet, phone, cellular)  Water and wastewater systems (e.g., reservoirs, pumping stations, transmission network, water treatment  plants, storm water system, wastewater treatment)  Typical information collected for individual buildings and infrastructure systems includes ownership, location, current  use, size, age, construction type, zoning, current condition (e.g., maintenance, retrofits, or upgrades)  along  with applicable codes, standards, and regulations at the time of design. Information on current conditions and  dependencies on other buildings or infrastructure systems is also necessary to understand functional connections.  This information will contribute to understanding how the built environment is expected to perform if one or more of  the systems, or a segment of a system, stops providing services (e.g., energy services). Infrastructure data may be  collected by public agencies or departments, regional planning commissions or metropolitan planning organizations,  or utilities  or they may be found in local plans (e.g., comprehensive plans, hazard mitigation plans) or GIS databases. Some communities draw upon standing service provider councils or establish them as part of their resilience  planning initiatives to define interdependencies among infrastructure systems and to develop compatible performance  goals and solutions. Additionally, community growth may have strained infrastructure capacity and the council can  provide input on future needs. Related to risk levels, overlaying spatial hazard information with infrastructure locations using GIS-based maps can  help communities understand whether their buildings or infrastructure systems are located in higher-risk areas. For  instance, many communities and key installations were established before flood zones were mapped or updated;  consequently, buildings and infrastructure systems may be subject to flood damage. Other communities have  buildings and infrastructure systems located in liquefaction zones and may not perform well if a significant seismic  event occurs.  One way to help identify and prioritize buildings and infrastructure systems is to ask for community feedback on the  question: What institutions and services are most important to you? Institutions and services often require more than  one building and can be addressed through building clusters that support functional categories oriented around types  of services provided. This information can help the planning team understand how elements of the built environment  work together to provide services before and after hazard events and will be used in Step 3. Further, functionality of  buildings and building clusters can be used to assess the value of alternative resilience projects, instead of relying  solely upon replacement value of an asset. For example:  Health care clusters: Hospitals and acute care facilities/services are under Critical Medical. Medical  provider offices are addressed under the Community Recovery functional category. Other health services,  such as pharmacies, dialysis clinics, and treatment centers should also be included where they are most likely  to be located.   Business clusters: A large employer may be placed in the Housing/Neighborhoods functional category  under the Critical Retail building cluster. For instance, building and infrastructure repairs may be needed for  short-term recovery. Other businesses may be placed under the Housing/Neighborhoods/Businesses or  Community Recovery functional categories. Banks and ATMs, gas stations, and supermarkets are examples  of other facilities/services that need to be considered for placement. ", "1469": "CONNECT COMMUNITY SOCIAL DIMENSIONS TO THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT Action 2-5: Link social functions to the built environment. The planning team should identify  links between social functions and the buildings and infrastructure systems that support them for  day-to-day operations and during a recovery process. Informed by these links, building clusters  and supporting infrastructure should be defined by how they support social functions. Once the social dimensions and built environment are characterized, social functions can be linked to their support by  buildings and infrastructure systems. This requires fact-finding and coordination among planning team members and  stakeholders.  Table 2-2 offers examples of links between various social institutions and transportation systems, as well as possible  direct and indirect impacts of transportation system damage. The Guide provides similar tables (Guide Tables 10-6  through 10-8) for other infrastructure systems that can assist planners understanding and identifying these linkages.  This action will offer fresh insights into how social functions and services depend on the built environment  and the  interdependencies among those systems.", "1470": "Action 3-1: Identify long-term community goals. The planning team should identify long-term  community goals that will inform or be affected by community resilience plans. Identifying community-level goals will assist in developing resilience strategies so that prioritized investments in  buildings and infrastructure will also promote the communitys ability to prepare for anticipated hazards, adapt  to changing conditions, and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions. In some cases, this approach might  find ways to achieve community goals not previously considered but would result in greater social, economic, and  resilience benefits. Community goals may already be identified or defined in a comprehensive or general plan, land-use plan, pre-disaster  recovery plan, hazard mitigation plan, and/or capital investment budget. Long-term community goals may go beyond  resilience planning but will be improved by including resilience. For example:  To attract new business investment, a community may wish to develop more resilient physical infrastructure,  such as increasing redundancy or diversity in transportation options  like an additional bridge to provide a  second access point for traffic to the downtown area or an industrial park.  To increase its social well-being and equity, a community may want to develop parks that also act as basins  for flood waters or it may seek to improve transportation access to underserved areas.  A community may need to improve the performance of its water or wastewater treatment plants to minimize  disruption of service and meet environmental requirements (e.g., reduce the risk of damage during hazard  events).  A community may want to diversify its economy with increased sources from a range of sectors and markets  to encourage positive economic growth and development.  A communitys population growth and its projected demands on healthcare institutions may call for expanded  health facilities that will also be functional immediately following a hazard event.", "1471": "Action 3-2: Determine desired performance goals for  buildings and infrastructure systems. The planning team  should determine specified times for recovery of functions or  services provided by building clusters and/or infrastructure  systems, with input from owners, operators, and other key  stakeholders. Long-term community goals should inform specific community resilience goals.  The desired performance goals are expressed as recovery times and should  build on the social and economic characteristics and needs of the community  from Step 2. For example:  The desired performance for critical facilities, such as emergency rooms and 911 call centers, is typically  continuous service or minimal disruption after a hazard event.   Most residents should be able to shelter in their homes or in emergency housing after a hazard event, and  utility services should be restored in a maximum of one or two weeks to keep residents in the community.   Small businesses and major employers need to resume within one-to-two weeks to maintain the economy;  schools and daycare need to have similar goals for resuming operations so all parents can work.   In contrast, it may be reasonable to set recovery times for non-emergency city services at weeks or months,  such as parks and recreation facilities. The desired recovery time between a hazard event and the recovery of community functions and services is  independent of the type of hazard. For instance, the desired recovery time for a hospital or utility will be the same for a  range of hazards (e.g., flood, hurricane, earthquake). This is because community needs are likely to be the same for  recovery of functions following any hazard event; the actual performance that is anticipated for a specific hazard event  (defined in Action 3-3) is evaluated separately in Action 3-4.", "1472": "The planning team should address questions that get to the heart of resilience requirements and help identify the  desired performance goals (see Boulder County Resilient Design Performance Standard) for the community, such as:   When and how much do the buildings and infrastructure systems supporting each business or institution  need to recover their intended functions and services?  What timeframe for recovery is needed for housing, schools, and businesses before the communitys ability to  serve its members is adversely affected?   Where is it reasonable to use temporary measures until repairs can be completed?  These kinds of resilience questions should be a critical focus for the planning team.  ", "1473": "Each community is different. For example, a performing arts center might not be critical in one mid-sized city; for a  smaller community where the center attracts tourists and is a primary supporter of downtown businesses, a shorter  recovery time may be strongly desired. For other communities, a manufacturing plant that is crucial to the countrys  military supplies may be determined to be much more critical than another type of factory.

This is a core value provided by community resilience planning.", "1475": "Communities should consider human and social needs when assigning building clusters to the three recovery phases.  Table 3-1 gives an example of building clusters listed for functional categories and recovery phases. Infrastructure  systems that support the clusters are not listed but also should be considered. While three recovery phases are designated, there will be considerable overlap in their initiation and completion, as  indicated in Figure 3-1. Functional Levels for Building Clusters. The Guide recommends using three functional levels for specifying the  desired time-to-recovery performance goal for building clusters. The percentages may vary, but generally meet the  following levels of recovery:  Minimal: 30% of building cluster is functional  minimum number of facilities needed to initiate the minimum  functions and services required of a building cluster  Functional: 60% of building cluster is functional  minimum number of facilities to meet the usual operations  (functions and services) of a building cluster  Operational: 90% of building cluster is functional  minimum number of facilities needed to declare that the  building cluster is operating at normal capacity  Setting functional levels helps define how a building cluster will meet the desired performance goal while addressing  immediate response needs following a hazard event.", "1476": "DEFINE COMMUNITY HAZARDS AND LEVELS Action 3-3: Define community hazards and levels. The planning team should identify the  prevailing hazards that will affect community functions and resilience. A better understanding of a communitys performance in terms of hazards and levels can be found by using three  levels for each prevailing hazard:  Routine events are more frequent but should cause minimal damage and no loss of community functions.  Design events are used to design the built environment; design loads are specified in building codes. For  many hazards, where the built environment meets current code requirements, there should be minimal  damage or loss of community functions.   Extreme events may also be defined in building codes for some hazards; they are the most likely to cause  extensive damage. Extreme events are evaluated to determine if critical functions will be available after a  hazard event. A community resilience plan should be anchored around the design hazard level.  The routine and extreme hazard levels are evaluated to ensure that the community is planning for a range of  possibilities. At the routine level, buildings and infrastructure systems should not experience any significant damage  that would disrupt social functions in the community.  At the extreme level, critical facilities and infrastructure systems should remain partially functional and able to support  the response and recovery of the community as defined by the performance levels. Other buildings and infrastructure  systems should perform at a level that protects the occupants, though they may need to be rescued. Emergency  response plans should be developed for scenarios based on this hazard level. For many hazards such as flood, wind,  earthquakes, and snow, design events are specified in codes and standards for the built environment. This information helps a community to understand how the built environment will perform and recover over a range of  hazard types and levels. The Guide lists three levels for hazards addressed in building codes and standards for natural  hazards in Guide Table 4-4.  When codes dont define design hazard levels (e.g., wildfires or tornadoes), the community can turn to available  guidance by professional organizations (e.g., the US Forest Service for wildfires, FEMA and ASCE for tornadoes).  Historical data may be useful for understanding hazards and consequences but need to be interpreted and used  carefully for future projections. For example, many communities have experienced multiple flooding events in various  locations, but these events may not meet or exceed the 100-yr or 500-yr flood events defined by FEMA. Flooding  may also occur in other locations if stormwater systems are overwhelmed or sea level rise contributes to flood  elevations. Many communities already have identified prevailing hazards  and their history, design-level severity, and probability  of occurring. As part of developing a hazard mitigation plan, planners conduct a risk assessment which includes  identifying all hazards affecting the planning area. This information appears in their plans for FEMA Hazard Mitigation  requirements, emergency operations, or continuity of operations. Table 3-2 lists the types of hazards that may have  a significant impact on a community. Further information on hazards is available in the Guide Section 4.1.3. Template  3-3 helps document community hazards and their event levels.", "1477": "Hazard occurrence vs impact. The occurrence of a hazard type and magnitude does not imply a level of impact,  such as damage and losses. The level of preparedness and resilience of a community can result in very different  outcomes. Hazard impact is a result of the consequences of a given hazard event. Two measures are used in the Guide to  indicate the anticipated consequences:   Affected area may be a portion of a community (local), most or all of the community (community), or across  the community and surrounding communities (regional).  Level of disruption to community functions may be handled within normal operations (minor), require activation  of community/state emergency response assistance (moderate), or require activation of federal emergency  response assistance (severe).

For each hazard event of interest, the planning team should determine the time to  recovery of community functions, accounting for dependencies and varying rates of recovery. This action considers how the communitys current building clusters and infrastructure systems would fare in a  potential hazard event that occurs in the near future. The estimate of performance, based on the current condition of  the built environment as characterized in Step 2, is referred to as the anticipated performance. The question being  addressed is: how long will it take to recover community functions for a hazard event given the current state of the  built environment and the estimated level of damage and loss? The anticipated recovery times are then compared to  the desired performance goals, also expressed as recovery times.", "1479": "Most buildings and infrastructure systems in service today were designed to serve their intended functions on a daily  basis under normal environmental conditions and routine hazard events. In addition, buildings and other structures are  designed to provide occupant safety during a design hazard event, but they may not continue to be functional.  Lack of experience with a damaging hazard event, and lack of understanding about the level of damage to be  expected when a significant hazard event occurs, can lead to misconceptions about a communitys vulnerability.  Communities can gain better insights into their vulnerabilities based on national experience, not just local events, and  can better address those vulnerabilities by adopting and enforcing land use guidelines and national model building  codes. The cost of compliance for new construction is often minimal compared to the cost of recovery and  reconstruction.", "1480": "There are multiple options for determining anticipated performance:  Expert Judgement: Estimate anticipated performance using expert judgment of the team, stakeholders, and  other experts as needed.  Past Hazard Experience: Estimate anticipated performance using data from past hazard events similar  to the hazard event being analyzed, taking into account changes to codes and new construction that have  occurred in the interim.   System-Level Assessment: Use performance assessments previously conducted for buildings or  infrastructure systems.  Building or Community-Level Assessment: Commission technical experts to assess anticipated  performance using available technical tools. The HAZUS modeling tool, for example, is commonly used to  assess the impact of earthquake, flooding, hurricane (wind and storm surge), and tsunami events on buildings  at a community scale. Current engineering practice for predicting the performance of buildings and infrastructure systems under specific  hazard events often is based on expert judgment or the past experience of other communities. For more detail, Guide  Chapters 12 through 16 provide considerations for estimating the performance of existing buildings and infrastructure  systems. Guide Brief 4 and Guide Brief 4A offer additional guidance on determining anticipated performance of the  built environment. Using the Guide Templates. The anticipated performance  time to operational recovery levels  needs to be  determined for buildings clusters and infrastructure systems and documented in Template 3-1 and Template 3-2 with the desired performance goals. It is important to include interdependencies between buildings and infrastructure  systems when determining anticipated, or expected, recovery levels. For example, an educational building cluster   all K-12 schools, administrative buildings, bus facilities, and maintenance facilities  requires buildings, power, water  and wastewater, and communications to be functional, and transportation routes for staff and students to reach the  facilities.", "1481": "The HAZUS modeling tool", "1482": "SUMMARIZE THE RESULTS Action 3-5: Summarize the results. The planning team should document the desired  performance goals and anticipated performance of existing buildings and infrastructure  systems by integrating the results from individual performance tables for building clusters and  infrastructure systems. This is accomplished by filling out the summary table for high-level  comparisons of buildings and infrastructure system gaps in performance (Table 3-4). The differences between the desired performance goals and anticipated performance provides a basis for evaluating  and prioritizing performance gaps. Significant gaps between desired and anticipated performance can guide the  development of solutions and strategies to meet long-term community goals and to improve community resilience in  Step 4. Table 3-4 illustrates the summary table of gaps between desired performance goals (in yellow, orange, and  green) and anticipated performance (in blue) for a design flood hazard event. Template 3-4 is a blank version of Table  3-4 that can be used by the Planning Team to complete this action.  The planning team can use the performance tables to improve communication among stakeholders and to support  a comprehensive, high-level summary of the integrated performance of a communitys buildings and infrastructure  systems. The largest gaps between desired and anticipated performance can be used to help prioritize resilience  strategies to improve the overall performance of the built environment and supported social functions.

Based on the information gathered and developed in Steps 1 to 3, the gaps between desired and anticipated  performance can be identified, including contributing factors and impacts or consequences for the community. The  gaps should be prioritized in terms of their importance in advancing the communitys resilience goals.  The planning team should also determine if performance gaps are addressed by ongoing or planned projects. For  example, plans to improve the stormwater system may not be as important to a communitys overall resilience as a  need for a second road or bridge to provide redundancy for emergency access or community evacuation during flood  or fire events. Consideration of the impacts and consequences of these projects toward community resilience goals   while taking available resources into account  will help inform the decision process. Community resilience priorities need to be considered alongside many competing needs and interests. If all key  stakeholders and current community plans are engaged in the resilience planning process, the range of interests  should be part of the evaluation. Additional considerations for prioritizing performance gaps and solutions are found in  Guide Brief 13.", "1484": "IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS Action 4-2: Identify solutions to address gaps including both administrative and  construction options. The planning team should identify potential solutions to address gaps  using both administrative and construction solutions. As the planning team has been specifying performance goals and estimating anticipated performance, the team likely  has been identifying possible solutions to maintain or quickly restore community functions and services. Community  resilience strategies often rely on a combination of administrative and construction solutions that are implemented  over the short, intermediate, and long term. In addition to solutions generated during the planning process, other  candidate solutions should be solicited from stakeholders. The community focus of the Guide can provide needed  context to individual project solutions proposed to community decision makers.  ", "1485": "Administrative Solutions A community may begin to address performance gaps by considering administrative solutions. Administrative policies  and actions can be employed to improve the quality of new construction, provide incentives for retrofit and mitigation  projects, and improve permitting and other administrative factors that impact recovery time after a hazard event. Administrative actions tend to carry lower implementation costs compared to construction solutions and can yield  significant long-term benefit, though they may require policy or legislative approval. All communities, large and  small, can identify and consider implementing these kinds of solutions to support their needs. Alternative land use  and redevelopment strategies, for example, may be a key part of improving resilience for many communities. As  an example, they often are relied upon in flood-prone hazard areas. Administrative solutions can be temporary or  permanent. Mutual aid agreements established in advance can speed up the recovery process so that key parts of  the infrastructure can be restored more readily.39 Communities can also adopt and enforce codes and standards with local amendments that strengthen resilience or  develop mutual aid agreements that support streamlines recovery processes. The potential administrative solutions (see the textbox for Action 4-2a) are not intended to be comprehensive,  nor prescriptive, and are not listed in any particular order. Communities may have other administrative solutions  that support their resilience goals and strategies. Some solutions may improve the efficiency and effectiveness of  developing a plan, for example, rather than addressing specific resilience needs or options.", "1486": "Construction Solutions Targeted construction projects can greatly enhance the built environments contribution to overall community  resilience and add redundancy or robustness to buildings and infrastructure systems. Construction solutions may be  the only option for addressing some of the resilience challenges the planning team identifies and prioritizes. That may  include new projects and mitigation projects (e.g., barriers, relocation, improvements, renovations).  New projects can be tailored to meet the community resilience goals for immediate and long-term needs. Mitigation  projects can help reduce damage from hazard events and support long-term resilience strategies. Both new and  mitigation projects can also reduce demands during recovery and speed the overall recovery process.  Construction solutions usually require capital improvement budget authority and may take considerable time to  complete the approval process. However, planned construction projects with resilience benefits often produce a list  of shovel ready projects that better position the community for funding opportunities by private sources or federal  agencies. This can include short-term or temporary solutions, such as modular or manufactured housing, to meet  immediate needs as well as longer-term projects, such as new or relocated developments, to improve community  resilience. Importantly, after a hazard event, construction solutions should be informed by the community resilience plan and  its goals for performance of buildings and infrastructure systems. This may include reducing or removing the hazard  (e.g., increasing elevation, relocation for flood events) and supporting infrastructure requirements (e.g., new utilities  for relocated development). Regardless of the approach taken, the key is to be thoughtful, innovative, inclusive, and  open-minded about creating the right mix of affordable solutions that will match community priorities and available  resources.  The potential construction solutions (see the textbox for Action 4-2b) may require long-term planning and capital  investment. Each community has differing capacities for capital investment.

Ideally,  resilience solutions and strategies should identify  opportunities to rapidly restore community  functions and services, and to improve the  resilience of the built environment.  The best time for implementing strategies is  prior to hazard events, but implementation  opportunities may occur after hazard events.  When the community is recovering from hazard  impacts, there is significant pressure to quickly  restore the built environment. Without pre- established strategies and solutions, communities  often default to targeting recovery to pre-event  conditions, potentially setting the community up  for the same performance and wasted resources.

All new projects and substantial  improvements should assess risks to climate change hazards in the context of  the projects purpose, asset type, site location, and funding, and then determine  the appropriate resilient design strategies using the Guidelines. The Guidelines  apply to all City capital projects except coastal protection projects (e.g. sea walls,  bulkheads, and levees), for which the City is developing separate guidance.  Implementing the Guidelines will result in designs that will make City facilities  more resilient to climate change and promote the health, safety, and prosperity  of New Yorkers.  The primary goal of the Guidelines is to incorporate forward-looking climate change data in the design of all City capital  projects. Codes and standards that regulate the design of facilities already incorporate historic weather data to determine  how to design for todays conditions. However, historic data does not accurately represent the projected severity and  frequency of future storms, sea level rise, heat waves, and precipitation. The climate is already changing and will  continue to change in significant ways over the full useful life of facilities designed today, threatening to undermine capital  investments and impede critical services if they are not designed to future conditions. The Guidelines complement the  use of historic data in existing codes and standards by providing a consistent methodology for engineers, architects,  landscape architects, and planners to design facilities that are resilient to changing climate conditions (see Figure 1).

For example, resilient design  choices should be made as an integral part of the Citys project planning, risk management, and financial planning.  Similarly, resilient design choices should be selected to maximize the efficacy and efficiency of investments. Some  ways this can be done include: 1) integrating soft resiliency strategies (operational measures or investments in green  infrastructure) and hard resiliency strategies (built or intensive investments); 2) addressing multiple climate hazards with  single interventions; and 3) reducing climate change risk in concert with other goals (e.g., energy efficiency or reduction in  greenhouse gas emissions).", "1518": "Climate Change in New York City The New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) provides regional climate change projections that inform  City resiliency policy.

Some new facilities built today, including  some buildings, may have an extended useful life beyond the values listed after undergoing substantial  improvements. Therefore, this list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Project teams should utilize professional  judgment to determine the useful lives of the facility and components in design.  Climate change projections for NYC, as defined by the NPCC, are broken into decadal projections. In the  Guidelines, the following decadal projections are associated with specific time spans:  2020s projection = present to 2039  2050s projection = 2040 to 2059  2080s projection = 2070 to 2099  2100 projection = end of century and beyond", "1520": "Throughout the Guidelines, particular actions are recommended depending on the criticality and/or the size of  a capital project. These two distinctions are summarized below: Criticality: Some facilities or components are classified as critical either because of the services they  provide (e.g., hospitals and key transportation assets) or their importance during an emergency (e.g.,  designated shelters and back-up energy generators). This classification determines levels of freeboard in the  sea level rise-adjustment section. See Table 3 in Section II.C for a full list of critical facilities for the application  of the Guidelines.  In complex facilities with multiple components, whether or not the full facility is considered critical, designers  should identify critical components. Critical components essential to the facilitys functionality should be  protected to the higher standard provided even if the facility itself is non-critical. For example, at a non-critical  vehicle maintenance yard, some components are critical to the functioning of the site, such as an emergency  generator. Critical component protection should also be evaluated if a facility is expected to be fully operational  during extreme weather, or if it is expected to quickly resume full operations after an event. Some examples of  critical components include:   boilers,   chemical feed equipment,   communications systems,   electrical distribution and switching areas,  elevators,  emergency fuel supplies,   emergency generators,   fire alarms and suppression equipment,   furnaces,   hazardous material storage,   HVAC units,   monitoring and safety equipment, and  motor-control centers.

Major projects are recommended to receive additional analysis  to ensure that all risks are identified and mitigated in a cost-effective manner. It is recommended that major  projects should perform a thorough climate risk assessment and full benefit-cost analysis (see Section III).  However, some projects with a total cost over $50 million may not require additional analysis if, for example,  the majority of costs relate to restoring natural areas or green space. If using the Guidelines on a major project,  please contact ORR at ResilientDesign@cityhall.nyc.gov.", "1522": "Climate change projections from the NPCC are the  product of state-of-the-art modeling and analysis.  However, as with all projections, there is uncertainty  embedded within them.9  The NPCC continues to  develop, review, and synthesize the latest climate data  for the metropolitan region, and new findings will be  incorporated into future versions of these Guidelines.  Given uncertainty, flexible adaptation pathways provide  a useful, iterative approach for managing uncertainty  and designing resilient facilities, particularly those with  a useful life that extends past 2050 - beyond which  the uncertainty of projections increases.10 Adaptation  pathways are particularly useful for expensive, long- lived, and highly complex facilities. They provide a way  to balance uncertainty with cost, as well as manage  operational and maintenance constraints. A facility can  be engineered with an adaptable protection level which  reduces risk to acceptable levels for part of its useful life  and can be re-evaluated as risk levels change.  Figure 2 illustrates a flexible adaptation pathway for a  critical facility component: an emergency generator with  an approximate useful life of 25 years located outside of  a non-critical building. The Guidelines recommend that  the foundation of the generator structure is designed to  match the useful life of the adjacent building, which is  built to the 2080s projections. Assuming the generator  is at risk from sea level rise and coastal surge, it should  be built on an elevated concrete slab that matches the  future year design flood elevation (DFE) corresponding  to the end of the generators useful life. The generator must be replaced when it reaches the end of its useful  life, which is less than that of the adjacent building. When the replacement generator is installed, the concrete  slab is further elevated to accommodate the future DFE. The foundation of the generator and the columns are  designed to support the additional future load from the elevated concrete slab. This initial investment allows for  future flexibility and avoided costs. Adaptation pathways may not apply equally to all types of projects or climate change projections. Flood  defenses, for example, may more easily incorporate an adaptation pathway than heat-vulnerable materials or  below-grade drainage systems. For this reason, the Guidelines conservatively use the middle of the 25th to  75th percentile range projections for sea level rise and the high-end 90th percentile projections for heat and  precipitation. For precipitation, the Guidelines use existing 50-year storm data as a proxy for the projected high- end 5-year storm (see Section II.B and Figure 5 for more details). Uncertainty can be further addressed through additional analysis, including a full climate change risk  assessment (see Section III for a methodology). This assessment will evaluate protecting the facility to  potentially higher levels than recommended in these Guidelines.

Discuss these considerations below as a project team to determine which apply and how to  respond:  Financing requirements: if the project is federally-funded, discuss with the funding agency if certain  protection standards or benefit-cost analyses are required. For example, FEMA-funded reconstruction  projects require specific flood protection standards for critical facilities and non-critical facilities.   Interdependencies: consider how climate hazards impact service or resource interdependencies between  the facility in design and other facilities or service utility providers, as well as the risks from coincident  events (e.g. extreme precipitation occurring during an extreme surge event) to specific projects.  Existing hazard mitigation projects and risk studies: evaluate if nearby or associated projects have  already been assessed for climate change risks. Identify if any studies have been conducted that could  inform design (e.g. local flood modeling with sea level rise).

The City has taken steps towards reducing building energy needs and local  temperatures, such as implementing the NYC Cool Roofs program.20 New buildings, as well as existing  buildings undergoing a roof membrane replacement, are required by law to utilize materials with high  reflectance and emittance factors. The Cool Roofs program expands on the code requirements by offering  existing buildings not going through a roof membrane replacement similar energy savings by applying a  highly reflective white coating to the normally dark traditional roofing materials, allowing the roof to reflect  solar radiation and absorb less heat.

Determining what loads are critical and how long  they should be powered for is essential for a facilitys operations and what the role of the facility will  have in an emergency situation.31  Depending on the size of the critical load and budget, different backup power supply options could  range from backup generators (e.g., diesel, natural gas) to hybrid systems (e.g., solar with battery  storage and an appropriately sized generator). Each option has different trade-offs that should be  considered in terms of cost, feasibility, and environmental impacts. For shorter duration needs and/or  smaller critical loads, buildings with existing solar systems should consider adding storage to provide a  resiliency benefit. In some cases, co-generation systems may be most appropriate, especially if there  is a significant heating and/or cooling load in addition to electricity demand.32  Depending on the backup option, assess the need to invest in internal electricity rewiring and  building energy management systems. Options include installing switches; reconfiguring distribution  infrastructure to isolate critical loads from non-critical loads; installing equipment to make it possible  to island system from the broader grid during larger disruption; providing software and hardware to  manage the deployment of hybrid systems; setting up external hookups for temporary generators and  boilers.33", "1536": " Failure in facility ventilation, electrical, and air conditioning systems: some systems designed to meet  the requirements of existing standards may overheat and fail during future extreme events.

Step 2: Define Impact Thresholds  Define the magnitude and type of impact for each relevant climate hazard that would need to occur to sig- nificantly hinder site operations, and the type of disruptions or damages one would expect. Before reviewing  specific impacts to the project it is important to understand the types of conditions that can have a detrimental  effect on the project. This can range from catastrophic events (e.g., hurricanes) to nuisance events (daily  flooding from high tide, heat amplification every afternoon in summer, etc.). Both types of events should be ex- amined. These events or conditions will be used in Step 4 in the evaluation of various types of consequences  and will allow the design team to coordinate with any appropriate agencies and reviews consistently. Step 3: Evaluate Likelihood Evaluate a projects physical hazard exposure and useful life to determine probability of climate-related im- pacts occurring over the projects lifetime and account for the way extreme heat, precipitation, and sea level  rise manifest over the project useful life. Exposure is a factor of the projects physical location, taking into ac- count the areas geographic susceptibility to extreme events or environmental change. Likelihood is the proba- bility of hazardous climate-related impacts occurring over the projects lifetime, and increases with the length of  a projects useful life. A likelihood rating is based on the projects physical hazard exposure and useful life, and  will help agencies understand how the threat posed by each climate hazard changes over time. For example,  a project with a useful life ending in 2100 is more likely to experience extreme events or conditions, such as  a 1% annual chance storm, than a project that has a useful life ending in 2030, and would therefore receive a  higher likelihood rating. Likelihood is rated on a tiered qualitative scale of nearly certain to rare. Step 4: Estimate Consequences Consequences come in many forms and are a product of the value and sensitivity of the exposed asset. Es- timate the potential damage, disruption, or strain to project assets and components, as well as to dependent  sectors and the surrounding community, that would result if a climate impact were to occur. Assess conse- III. ToolkitNYC Mayors Office of Recovery and Resiliency Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines - Version 3.0 34 quence regardless of the likelihood of occurrence. For example, if the first floor of a building were inundated  for several days due to a coastal storm, the consequence of this flooding would be the same irrespective of  its likelihood. Consequence ratings rely on users technical and institutional knowledge of the sensitivity of the  projects internal and external systems to climate impacts, and of the potential severity of the hazard occurring. Step 5: Summarize Risk Assess a projects risk to all climate hazards using the likelihood and consequence rating scores generated in  Steps 3 and 4. Summarize the results and identify notable trends.

This section provides benefit-cost analysis (BCA)  methodologies and tools to calculate and compare the incremental costs of using the Guidelines with the  incremental benefits. These resources will aid in making decisions when selecting between various resilient  design strategies. The main guiding principle in the development of the BCA methodologies included here was to balance  simplicity with accuracy. However, types of benefits can vary by climate hazard and by the type of facility;  benefit categories identified here may not cover all the potential benefits provided by every facility type within  New York City. In particular, the benefits of planning for increased precipitation are difficult to quantify and the  project design team should incorporate additional data as new inputs become available.  For projects with construction costs below $50 million, the project team is recommended to perform a  qualitative benefits assessment on the interventions that meet the Guidelines recommendations for all  applicable climate hazards. For projects with construction costs over $50 million, or projects that are highly  complex and critical, the project design team is recommended to perform an in-depth quantitative benefit  calculations to identify the optimal interventions that meet Guidelines recommended design criteria.", "1576": "There are three types of project benefit categories: direct benefits, indirect benefits, and other benefits.  Assessed together, these can be used to perform qualitative assessments and develop quantitative estimates  of monetary benefits for interventions that meet the Guidelines recommendations. These project benefit  categories can be used to perform a high-level benefit-cost analysis that balances accuracy with an appropriate  level of effort.  Direct benefits include reduced or avoided physical damages to facilities and contents, reduced or avoided  displacements for residential structures, and reduced life cycle or O&M costs that can be quantified as a  primary result of implementing a specific hazard mitigation measure. Table 12 in Appendix 5 provides a list  of direct benefits and basic guidance on estimating and documenting values for sea level rise and increased  precipitation-related flood hazards. Note that given the current state of practice, it is not possible to quantify  reduced or avoided physical damages or residential displacements that result from specific extreme heat  mitigation measures. Therefore, direct benefits applicable to extreme heat hazards are limited to reduced  life cycle costs applicable to certain measures, such as green roofs (refer to Table 15 for more details).   Indirect benefits include reduced or avoided service losses for non-residential buildings, public facilities,  and/or infrastructure (e.g., utilities, roads, and bridges) based on the value of service continuity and/ or emergency services to New Yorkers that can be quantified as a secondary result of implementing a  specific hazard mitigation measure. Table 13 in Appendix 5 provides a list of indirect benefits and basic  guidance on estimating and documenting values for sea level rise and increased precipitation-related flood  hazards. Note that given the current state of practice on extreme heat, it is not possible to quantify reduced  or avoided service losses that result from specific extreme heat mitigation measures. Therefore, indirect  benefits applicable to extreme heat hazards are limited to reduced energy costs such as cool roofs, green  roofs, shade trees, and so on (refer to Table 15 in Appendix 5 for more).  Other benefits can include social benefits for residents such as avoided stress and anxiety, avoided lost  productivity, environmental/ecosystem service benefits, avoided need for emergency services, and other  potential benefits. These can be estimated as after implementing a specific hazard mitigation measure.

As the project design team is developing design alternatives to meet the Guidelines criteria,  it is important to compare the added costs and benefits of those alternatives when in excess of NYC code  and standards requirements (baseline conditions). It is assumed that the project design team will develop  alternatives to address each of the following applicable climate hazards - sea level rise/coastal storm surge,  increased precipitation and extreme heat - separately.  This assessment allows agencies to screen the qualitative benefits for various alternatives that would then  lead to development of final project components to match the available budget and goals of the project.  Use Table 5 as a template to evaluate resilient design alternatives using a set of general evaluation criteria  and metrics. Develop appropriate evaluation criteria and metrics for each of the project benefit categories  applicable to the capital project being assessed. Tables 12-15 in Appendix 5 provides a list of typical direct,  indirect, and other benefits provided by various intervention typologies to reduce impacts from climate hazards.  See Table 6 for an example of how to complete the template. The template can be customized to meet project  goals and objectives.  During the qualitative assessment, the project design team should assess how intervention strategies will  have varying levels of reliability, effectiveness, benefits, and cost implications. For each alternative, the project  design team could use either a scoring, weighting, ranking, or other type of qualitative assessment framework  to assess each applicable project benefit category with the developed evaluation criteria and metrics.

Give consideration to non-monetary benefits such as quality of life and social resiliency to justify  the need for additional resiliency investment costs. This approach aligns with FEMAs approach of using social  and environmental benefit categories when calculating benefits and costs. In this analysis, estimated project benefits are combined with the project costs, which are defined as the  differential construction and long-term operation and maintenance costs associated with designing and  constructing a proposed project to the Guidelines recommended design level.

A communitys network of plans  are cornerstones because they  1) represent the communitys vision, 2) set goals, and 3) guide community development, actions, and policy decisions. The Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard aims to: 1. Identify incongruities within networks of plans. The scorecard  will reveal areas of compatibility and harmony between plans, but also uncover plan and policy conficts that may exacerbate existing vulnerabilities or create new ones. By identifying such incongruities and overlaying them with hazards and measures of physical and social vulnerability, communities can focus on areas with the greatest risk, prioritize projects with multiple benefts, and adjust plans and policies for greater alignment and increased resilience. 2. Help integrate and improve local plans in ways that reduce losses from hazard events. 11 The NRC recommends focusing on land use strategies and tools  to mitigate hazards in the long- term.12 Researchers have long  discussed the positive impacts  land use policies have on reducing  vulnerabilities.13 The Plan  Integration for Resilience Scorecard  evaluates not only land use plans,  but the entire range of plans that  spatially infuence a community encouraging comprehensive  preparedness and mitigation.  3. Provide communities developing new plans or updating existing plans with a framework to reduce future hazard risk through smarter and more consistent policies. The  methodical approach can be used to monitor and assess progress of the coordination of networks of plans for hazard vulnerabilities.

The frst thing to consider  is whether the policy impacts an  area of the community exposed to  hazards (located within a hazard  zone). Remember, the Plan Inte- gration for Resilience Scorecard  is a spatial evaluation tool based  on vulnerabilities, so policies that  are included should intersect the  spatial extent of a hazard. If you  are unsure of whether a policy Creating Your Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard 22 infuences a part of the communi- ty in a hazard zone (hazard zones  will be delineated in Map Task 2),  include it anyway. The policy can  be omitted later if you fnd there is  no impact on hazard zones. Second, as you read a policy, think  about whether it might increase or  decrease vulnerability to hazards.  For instance, a policy from Wash- ington, North Carolina, states:  Encourage higher-density mul- tifamily development in pedes- trian-oriented urban areas with  access to transit, a broad range of  services and amenities and access  to employment. This policy encourages greater  residential population density in  pedestrian-oriented urban areas  (see Table 2.2).  Although this is an efective  New Urbanist policy to increase  walkability and reduce carbon  emissions, if areas are located in  hazard zones it would increase the  number of people and structures  in harms way. You may fnd that  many policies in your plans have  good intentions, but have the po- tential to exacerbate hazard risk.  Also, keep in mind that the Plan  Integration for Resilience Score- card is not just assessing whether  your community is in or out of a  hazard zone. In other words, the  evaluation is not two-dimensional.  If, for example, the above policy  referred to higher density multi- family development in the same  areas, but specifed vertical  elevation of the residential foor  above the base food elevation  or special building codes to  withstand hazard impacts, this  policy would decrease vulnera- bility. Be aware of these nuanc- es, which can change the score  a policy receives.

By recording the ways it meets  (or fails to meet) each of the three  criteria described above (2.1  vulernability, 2.2 place-specifc, and  2.3 policy tool), you will prepare  the policy list for scoring. Do not be  discouraged if you fnd that many  of your policies fail to meet one  or more of the criteria upon closer  inspection. It is typical for 20%  (or more) of policies to drop out  during this step if you cast a wide  net as adviced in Policy Task 2.  Validating and preparing your  policies has several benefts. First, it  provides valuable documentation  of each policys key components  and your logical reasoning. Second,  it reduces confusion and facilitates  a smoother policy scoring process.  Third, it generates a new list  of policies excluded from the  scorecard, but are potentially  low-hanging fruit (Chapter 4).  Despite their exclusion from the  fnal scorecard, these policies  are currently part of an adopted  plan and, therefore, guiding  community development and  management. Excluded policies  represent opportunities for later  adjustments that will strengthen  plan integration and resilience in  your community. 3.1 Confrm and Assign  Directionality When reviewing a policy, frst  consider whether and how it  meets the vulnerability criterion.  If you confrm that it is likely to  positively or negatively afect  vulnerability, jot down a few  notes in the Vulnerablity column  regarding your reasoning.  Once you have confrmed the  directionality, you may fnd it  helpful to color-code your policies   in, say, green (if it is likely to have a positive efect) or red (negative  efect). If you think a policy in your list is  unlikely to afect vulnerability  or  that its efect could just as easily be  positive as negative, given the way  it is phrased  you may choose to:  move it to the low-hanging fruit list and set it aside for later consideration during a future plan revision, OR  leave the policy in the scorecard, but note its neutrality (e.g. color-code it beige or yellow). In this case, you will still spatially assign the policy during the scoring step, but will not give it an actual scoremarking it, instead, with a 0 as a place holder. As long as you are spatially assigning policies, doing so for these neutral policies will not constitute much additional work, but may prove even more valuable during a plan revision process than if you simply move them to the  low-hanging fruit list.  Whatever you decide, policies  that will likely have negative or  neutral efects on vulnerability  will be prime candidates for  adjustment (or deletion!) as you  work to improve integration  and build resilience to hazards  through wise plan and policy  guidance. 3.2 Confrm and Record  Place-specifc Term For each policy, also confrm  that it contains a place-specifc  term that will allow you to spa- tially assign it during the scoring  step. As before, writing a few  notes in the appropriate column   this time the Place-specifc Term column  will help clar- ify your thinking. Be sure that these notes contain the actual place-specifc term from the policy and, if appropriate, a brief explanation about how it ought to be spatially defned in your community. Keep in mind that you may fnd  policies that you believe are  applicable throughout the entire  hazard zone (or zones).

Making such policies more  explicitly place-specifc by adding  a place-specifc term(s) during  your plan revision process may  strengthen them and improve  your plans ability to foster greater  resilience. As an added bonus, when you  fnish this step (Policy Task 3.2) for  all of your policy lists, your notes  from the Place-specifc Term col- umn can be given to your GIS team  to help them with Map Task 4. If  they can develop a comprehen- sive set of maps/shapefles/layers  of place-specifc terms, this will  dramatically improve your ability  to spatially assign policies during  the scoring step. 3.3 Confrm and Record Policy  Tool Finally, confrm that each policy  contains an actionable policy  tool(s) and record it (them) in the  Policy Tool column, along with a  brief explanation, if needed. Use  Section 2.3 and Tables 2.4 and 2.5 to  help you decide what, if any, tool is  suggested by the policy.

Analyzing the community by planning districts, rather than  as a whole, also helps reveal spatial diferences in vulnerability. The  smaller the planning district, the more fne-grained the analysis.  1.1 Choose Planning Districts Planning districts are important to identify because planning eforts  often attempt to coordinate policies within such areas. That being said,  communities should determine their planning districts according to  their specifc goals and circumstances. Generally, there are three mains  strategies for selecting planning districts:  1. Readily available data: U.S. Census block groups (or tracts, depending on the size of your community) are a convenient and widely utilized sub-jurisdictional spatial unit. 2. Neighborhoods: Some communities have well-defned neighborhoods that are widely used for planning and policymaking. If this sounds like your community, youre in luck! 3.

Your community may be more  interested in other hazard zones,  such as surge zones, wave action  locations, or dam inundation areas.  It is also common for communities  to bufer food hazard areas,  acknowledging changes in food  patterns, as opposed to only  using the 100-year foodplain.  Increasingly, communities are  rethinking the usefulness of the  100-year foodplain as a planning standard; Houston is considering replacing it with the current 500- year foodplain for planning and regulatory purposes (CITE), given that citys history of devastating storms. If your community is exposed  to more than coastal fooding  hazards, we encourage you to  explore their spatial relationships  and modify the Plan Integration  for Resilience Scorecard to ft  your needs.

Take some time to collect maps of  your place-specifc terms so that  you can better understand their  exposure to hazards, and how this  may afect vulnerability in your  district-hazard zones.  Keep in mind, you do not need  map layers for every place-specif- ic term. For example, in Norfolk,  Virginia, an often-referenced  place-specifc term within poli- cies was shoreline. The city did  not create a separate shapefle  or special map for this geogra- phy, because it was intuitive and  easily recognizable. Place-specifc  terms that might require mapping  include repetitive loss structures,  critical facilities, public housing,  natural areas, historic districts,  etc. If you are able, set up layers or  maps in GIS software so that you  can easily turn layers on and of as  needed, allowing you to see where  they overlap with your district  hazard zones. ships between individual policies,  natural hazards, and the various  parts of your community, it may  be useful to collect or create maps  that refect the place-specifc terms  found within the policies (Figure  2.7). Doing so will help you spatial- ly assign policy scores to diferent  parts of the community, resulting  in a Plan Integration for Resilience  Scorecard that can help inform  changes to improve resilience. If you remember, in Washington,  NC, several policies included  place-specifc terms such as con- servation areas and natural areas,  which can be overlaid (or com- pared) with hazard zones. Such  conservation areas are likely to  reduce vulnerability by absorbing  food waters.

A score of 0 indicates the policy is neutral and has no efect on vulnerability, whether positively or negatively, in the district-hazard zone.  Not applicable indicates that the policy does not refer to the district- hazard zone (or the policys place- specifc term is not located in the district-hazard zone). Scores for not applicable (NA) may be added to the spreadsheet to avoid confusion and enhance recognition of the spatial impact of policies on district-hazard zones. The NAs will not afect the summed index scores, and cells left empty may be confused as not yet scored. Consider blacking-out district- hazard zone cells that are NA. However, if your team is comfortable with leaving these cells blank to indicate NA, you may do so. To help you quickly and accurately score  policies, display the district-hazard zone  map with the place-specifc term layer of  the policy you are spatially assigning. If  set up in a GIS, you can easily toggle map  layers on and of for each place-specifc  term. For instance, a policy may refer to  the place-specifc term wetlands. The  next policy may refer to the place-specifc  term public housing. If you have these as  layers within your map, you can easily see  where they are locatedand within which  district-hazard zone(s). Below are several examples of policies and  explanations of their policy scores and  locations. Additional examples may be  found in Table 2.8. Using the Plan Integration for  Resilience Scorecard spreadsheet  (see Appendix C), assign each policy  in your fnal policy lists to the  appropriate district-hazard zone.  The sum of all scores assigned to  each district-hazard zone will result  in an index policy score for that  area of the community, which can  be compared and mapped (see  Chapter 3: ANALYSIS). Furthermore,  the compilation of all district- hazard zone scores results in a total  score for each planning document.  An example scorecard is shown in  Table 2.8. First, observe the way each policy  was determined to afect hazard  vulnerability. Every district-hazard  zone (cell on the spreadsheet) will  receive a score of +1, -1, 0, or  not applicable for every policy,  depending on how the policy is  likely to afect vulnerability in that  part of the community.   A score of +1 indicates that a policy positively afects (that is, it reduces) vulnerability for a specifc district-hazard zone. In other words, it reduces (directly or indirectly) the exposure of people or structures to the hazard or mitigates the negative efects of the hazard.  A score of -1 indicates that a policy negatively afects (that is, it increases) vulnerability for a specifc district-hazard zone.

By producing a PIRS, you have not  only spatially evaluated your network of plans and improved your  understanding of how policies are likely to afect vulnerability, but also  organized your data to facilitate efective comparison and visualization. Tables Tables are a simple and powerful way to display complex results, such  as those from your resilience scorecard, and to inform further analysis.  Your fnished scorecard enables the production of tables that contain  the summed values (index policy scores) for each district-hazard zone. A  useful summary table might contain lines with these summed values for  each separate plan in your network, along with a line for the composite  values (total scores across all plans). Other tables can be created  according to your analytical needsfor example, it might be useful to  create a table that indexes only the negative-scoring policies, so that you  can determine the district-hazard zones in need of the most attention.", "1615": "Maps To go a step further, you can  create choropleth maps (which  use shading or coloring to display  diferences in value) from the totals  and sub-totals in your scorecard.  If you are working in GIS, this may  be accomplished by joining your  summary table(s) to your district- hazard zone layer(s) (see Box 3.1).  Maps are an informative way to  visualize your resilience scorecard  resultswhich are, after all,  intentionally spatial!

Each district-hazard zone  score on the map corresponds  to a summed value (index policy  score) in the scorecard. Notice  that areas outside the hazard  zones are not given scores,  because they are not included in  the resilience scorecard analysis,  which is confned to parts of the  community at higher hazard risk.", "1616": "Analysis Your PIRS tables and maps  enable many diferent kinds of  evaluation. Although analysis may  be undertaken using tables alone,  maps help make the results more  intuitive and compelling, and  help with pattern identifcation.  Three useful methods of analysis  are explained below, but you are  encouraged to explore others. 1. First, we might compare diferences between hazard zones. For instance, in the CAMA Core Land Use Plan (Figure 3.2, top left map), the western-most district (District 2) is shown to have more policies focused on reducing vulnerability in the current hazard zone (100-year foodplain; hatched) than in  the future hazard zone (2100  sea-level rise; dotted). In the  same way, we can observe that  in Districts 7 and 8, the CAMA Core Land Use Plan contains  a policy mix that is likely to  reduce vulnerability in the  current hazard zones, while  the policies focused on the  future hazard zone are likely  to increase vulnerabity. These  fndings may indicate the need  for adjustments to the policies  that afect specifc district- hazard zonesa process  facilitated by the organization  of the scorecard. This step is  explained in greater detail in  Chapter 4.", "1617": "2. We might also use the tables and maps to compare policy scores across plans. In Washington, NC, the Comprehensive Plan (Figure 3.2, top right map) and the CAMA Core Land Use Plan (top left) contain policies that increase vulnerability in certain district- hazard zonesparticularly in Districts 1, 3, and 5. In contrast, the Hazard Mitigation Plan (bottom left) and Parks and Open Space Plan (bottom right) actively decrease vulnerability throughout the city, including in Districts 1, 3, and 5. This apparent inter- plan confict may require  further investigation and  reconciliation (the subject of  Chapter 4). 3. Finally, the maps can be used to identify policy hot spots  and policy cool spots in the cityareas receiving much or relatively little policiy attention, respectively, from the plans. These can be identifed for individual plans as well as for the network of plans, as a whole. For examples of hot spots, we can observe the Composite Policy Score", "1618": "Map for all plans in Washington (Figure 3.3). It is clear that several  district-hazard zones contain an overall policy mix that is likely to  increase vulnerability (areas in pink), while others contain many  policies that are likely to reduce it. These results suggest the need  to prioritize policy changes and investments in resilience measures  in parts of District 1, 5 and 8, where the greatest incongruities exist  among the plans and where vulnerability is likely to be increased.  The city might look for inspiration to District 2, where the policy mix  appears well-aligned toward reducing vulnerability. Washingtons Comprehensive Plan (Figure 3.2, top right map) provides  an examples of a cool spot. Both district-hazard zones in Districts 2,  4, and 5 display policy scores of zero. In Districts 2 and 5, this is due to  intraplan policy confictan equal number of policies likely to reduce  vulnerability as likely to increase it in these areas. In District 4, however,  it signifes the absence of policies. Washingtons Comprehensive Plan focuses more policy attention on the central, developed portion of the  community (much of it actually increasing vulnerability) than in the  outlying areas. This lack of policy attention for some hazard-prone areas  could prove problematic, and may merit further discussion (see Chapter  4). Some of the results of your policy score analysis may seem  discouragingbut dont lose sight of what the evaluation really is:  a diagnosis that reveals how various policies are pulling in diferent  directions. The path forward, toward greater community resilience, is to  adjust and adapt policies and priorities based on this new knowledge,  as will be detailed in Chapter 4. To help prioritize these adjustments  and interventions, we recommend that you also conduct vulnerability  assessments and compare the results with those from your scorecared.", "1619": "On its own, your Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard can reveal a  lot about your communitys network of plans, including the existence  and geographic focus of policies that may exacerbate vulnerability. It  is important to remember, however, that not everything or everyone  responds to a hazard event in the same way. Understanding what parts  of your community are likely to face greater challenges in rebounding  from a disaster will help focus and prioritize your policy changes and  investments. Therefore, in addition to evaluating policy scores in your  network of plans, we encourage you to explore diferent measures of  physical and social vulnerability.  This section describes several techniques for spatially evaluating  vulnerabilities and using the results, together with your scorecard, to  better recognize vulnerability hot spots and areas of policy-vulnerability  mismatch (see Figure 3.4).", "1620": "Physical vulnerability refers to  the built environment, including  buildings and infrastructure,  exposed to hazards. The location  and vulnerability of critical facilities  is of special concern.  Social vulnerability refers to  the people, households, or even  neighborhoods and communities  exposed to hazards.

What infrastructure  roads;  public transportation services;  stormwater drains; food control  structures; electrical, water, and  wastewater lines and facilities   will be damaged or afected?

While not a comprehensive  indicator of physical vulnerability  (and with the notable drawback  that some appraisals may be out- of-date), improved parcel value  data are useful for several reasons: 1. All communities are required to maintain publicly available property appraisal records, making for easy access to relevant data; and 2. Improved parcel value is an accepted proxy of investments in the community. To perform this physical  vulnerability assessment, frst  gather the latest improved parcel  value data from the appraisal  records database (usually provided  by the county assessor). Also,  obtain the latest parcel boundary  shapefle with the parcel codes which should also be publicly  available. Create a GIS layer by  joining the improved parcel value  data to the parcel boundary  shapefle, using the parcel code  that is shared by both datasets.  Then, fnd the average improved  parcel value for each district.  Location of Critical Facilities Another important aspect  of physical vulnerability in a  community is the location of  critical facilities. Critical facilities  are structures and infrastructure  that are essential to the proper  functioning of a community,  especially during and immediately", "1621": "following a disaster. They  typically include hospitals, police  and fre departments, schools,  water/wastewater treatment  facilities, electrical facilities,  public transportation facilities,  and even so-called commercial  critical facilities like pharmacies  and grocery stores.

Information on critical facilities is  typically collected and updated  by emergency managers as part  of the hazard mitigation planning  process. If facility locations can be  obtained, overlay them with the  scorecard and other vulnerability  maps. This will enable the  identifcation of district-hazard  zones that contain critical facilities,  adding another important element  to your analysis.

This suggests  something of a policy-vulnerability  mismatch with respect to social  vulnerability in District 5, and a  need for higher prioritization.  Opportunities exist to increase  resilience in this highly socially  vulnerable area by adjusting  existing policies and incorporating  hazard mitigation and social equity  more efectively in plans and  policy initiatives (see Chapter 4). ", "1627": "Advancing Plan Integration: Adjusting and Adding  Policies Your Plan Integration for Resil- ience Scorecard and vulnerability  analysis results provide you with  the information needed to make  informed policy adjustments  that strengthen the integration  of your network of plans toward  greater resilience and enhance  its focus on areas of particularly  high vulnerability. The process  of amending plans and policies  should ideally also be informed a  comprehensive community en- gagement efort (see Advancing  Knowledge section, below). By  prioritizing policy hot/cool spots,  vulnerability hot spots, and areas of  policy-vulnerability mismatch  but  also remembering to look compre- hensively across your community  and network of plans  you can ad- just, add, expand, or even remove  policies to improve plan alignment  and reduce vulnerability.  Using the information gathered,  scrutinize your scorecard, focus- ing on areas of concern, but also  thinking about policies that might  have a broad impact. Take the time  to consider policy alternatives,  including those that might be  added or amended with minimal  efort, cost, or opposition. Work  with internal staf and elected and  appointed ofcials to develop and  prioritize policy changes, informed  by feedback from stakeholder  groups (again, see below). Develop  a phased action plan with time- lines to address priorities, which  can help guide legislative changes  and facilitate greater plan integra- tion when updating existing plans  or drafting new ones. Actions may  include:   Adjusting policies within ex- isting plans (see Examples of Policy Adjustment, below)  Amending development reg- ulations and other ordinances (e.g. subdivision or zoning or- dinances)  Undertaking a new resilience planning process, such as that described in the NIST Commu- nity Resilience Planning Guide For controversial or harder-to-im- plement changes, discuss alterna- tive strategies with ofcials. There  is no easy answer for communities  that desire economic investment  in hazardous areas. Return-on-in- vestment and other mechanisms  may be used to facilitate decision- making. Policies do not change the  environment overnight, however;  governments have an opportunity  to guide development toward saf- er areas or in safer ways to avoid  the negative fall-out feared by  those concerned.", "1628": "Advancing Knowledge  The Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard method is not only about  generating and evaluating policy scores and vulnerability; the broader  knowledge derived from going through the process is an important  beneft. Staf and stakeholder knowledge begins to grow right from  the start, as silos are broken down through exposure to the communi- tys entire network of plans. Application and analysis of the scorecard  provides a deeper understanding of how the communitys network of  plans  including plans not explicitly intended to address hazard mitiga- tion  are linked to mitigation and disaster loss. Planning staf in the the  demonstration communities testify to the value of the scorecard process  in advancing knowledge about their plans and policies in relation to  hazard threats:  ", "1629": "Advancing Resilience  After you have adjusted and added policies  informed by your Plan In- tegration for Resilience Scorecard and vulnerability analysis results and  community engagement eforts  your well-integrated and resilience-fo- cused network of plans can be used to guide your community in a more  resilient direction. Rectifying instances of inter-plan confict will reduce  confusion as you move forward in developing and managing a commu- nity that is less vulnerable to the efects of natural hazards. Prioritizing  areas of high vulnerability (vulnerability hot spots), areas receiving little  policy attention (policy cool spots) or that have a lot of policies likely to  increase risk (policy hot spots), and areas of policy-vulnerability mismatch will help focus attention and resources on the places that are most in  need. Better-informed staf, decisionmakers, stakeholders, and com- munity members can work together to efectively advance the cause of  resilience. The scorecard can also be used to help your community monitor its  progress in advancing resilience. By periodically reevaluating your net- work of plans and comparing your scorecard results to those achieved  previously, you can confrm that you are on the right trackor discover  that you are heading in the wrong direction and work to change course.  In a similar way, you might evaluate your communitys regulations and/ or implementation in reference to your scorecard results. The Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard is a tool designed to help  communities confront the pervasive threat of natural hazards. Ofering  a new perspective on the integration of networks of plans and the infu- ence of policies on vulnerability, it can be used to more efectively guide  eforts toward advancing resilience.", "1630": "The core directive of the Community Resilience Building Workshop is  to foster collaboration with and among community stakeholders that  will advance the education, planning and ultimately implementation  of priority actions.  This directive is achieved through a carefully crafted, facilitated  approach centered on a unique catalyst  the Risk Matrix. The  Risk Matrix structures the capture and organization of community  dialogue and helps to generate the momentum needed to advance  resilience building. The Workshops central objectives are to:  define extreme weather and natural and climate-related  hazards,  identify existing and future vulnerabilities and strengths,   develop and prioritize actions for the community and broader  stakeholder networks, and  identify opportunities for the community to advance actions to  reduce risks and build resilience. The following Community Resilience Building Workshop Guide is  designed to provide clear instructions on how to lead your community  towards improved resilience.

Consider sending a pre-workshop Community  Characterization Survey to identified participants to  efficiently capture core information about how the  community currently perceives, assesses, and acts to  reduce risks.  An additional approach, if situations and time permit, is a pre- workshop listening session for stakeholders to verbally and  visually present their stories, photos, scientific information  on hazards and future projections. Information shared can be  synthesized with other materials in preparation for Workshop.", "1635": "Decide on participant grouping for workshop (core team).  Central to the successful application of the Community Resilience  Building Workshop is to open (Section B-1) and close (Section E)  the Workshop with large team (all participants) sessions; with  small team sessions in between (Section B-2 through Section D).  This large-small-large team dynamic allows for detailed input  from individuals along with a collective synthesis for comprehen- sive community resilience building. The critical step of assigning  participants to small teams depends on attendance with 40-50  participants and 6-8 people per small team (no more than 10) as  the ideal.

Where, how often, and in what ways?  What hazards are impacting your community currently?  Where, how often, and in what ways?  What effects will these hazards/changes have on your  community in the future (5, 10, 25 years)?  What is exposed to hazards and climate threats within your  community?

The  Risk Matrix captures the communitys Top Hazards,  vulnerabilities, strengths, and actions. The Risk Matrix  provides information necessary to develop strate- gies, inform community plans and advance actions to  lessen hazard impacts and build resilience.", "1638": "Identify infrastructural vulnerabilities and strengths (small teams). Infrastructure such as residential housing, schools, commercial building, churches, office parks/campuses, laboratories,  roads, bridges, and utilities among others can be vulnerable to hazards as well as serve to strengthen the community. The  objective of this step is to identify infrastructural vulnerabilities and strengthens across the entirety of the community.  1 (i) List infrastructural features. On the Risk Matrix, list  infrastructural featuressuch as housing, commercial  buildings, roads, and utilitiesthat have been or could  be affected by the Top Hazards. Identify those that have  withstood, could withstand, and/or are critical to maintain  and improve. Examples: Communications systems, evacu- ation signage, and emergency operating centers. Refer to  Triggering Questions to accelerate dialogue. (ii) Describe locations via participatory mapping. For  each feature, describe the specific location. Mark the loca- tion on the community basemap provided. Be sure to label  in such a way as to be legible after the Workshop. (iii) Identify ownership. Add information about who  owns or has responsibility for each feature listed.  Examples: City, county, state, private, association, depart- ment, agency, and corporate. (iv) Identify each feature as vulnerability or strength.  Assign each listed feature with V or S, or both. In some  cases, a community feature is both a vulnerability and  strength. Example: One municipality identified a pond as  a strength and vulnerability because it served as a water  source for the community, yet posed a flooding risk to  adjacent homes and a church if not drawn down prior to  major rainstorms. Examples of Vulnerabilities:   Main road floods during storms, blocking emergency response.  Power outages during heat waves lead to health concerns.  Wildfire and high winds resulting in supply chain interruptions.  Sewer pump stations become submerged and inoperable.  Compromised rail system due to heat-related warping of tracks. Examples of Strengths:   Critical road elevated and passable by emergency management.  Hurricane roof installed at school with improved sheltering capacity.  Hardened utility lines reduce outages due to ice storms.  Undersized culvert replaced to reduce flooding in key intersection.  Improvement to communication systems during extreme weather. Triggering Questions:  What infrastructure/facilities are exposed to current and future hazards? Transportation, waste water treatment, nursing  homes, schools, office park, hazardous materials facility, dams,  laboratories, churches, pharmacies, groceries, gas stations?  What makes this infrastructure vulnerable? Location, age,  building codes, type of housing?  What are the consequences of this infrastructure being vulnerable? Lack of access to critical facilities  urgency care/ pharmacies?", "1639": "Identify societal vulnerabilities and strengths (small teams). Social vulnerability is a combination of the factors and forces that affect the susceptibility of various groups within a commu- nity to harm as well as their collective ability to respond positively after extreme event and/or more routine, ongoing hazards.  Social vulnerability involves such factors as the availability of health care services and access to lifelines (food/water, emer- gency response personnel, etc.). Social strengths are often represented by those support networks that connect and main- tain the supply of goods and services to impacted groups within the community. The objective of this step is to identify  the people, places, and services that are at risk from the Top Hazards as well as those that currently add strength to the  communities overall resilience. 2 (i) List societal features. On the Risk Matrix, list societal  features. Consider factors that affect the ability of groups  to deal with adverse impacts from hazards. Conversely,  consider factors or characteristics that increase the capa- bility of groups to negate, withstand, and quickly recover  from hazards. Refer to Triggering Questions to accel- erate dialogue. (ii) Describe locations via participatory mapping. For  each feature, describe the location. Be as specific as  possible. Legibly mark the location on the community  basemap provided. Examples: Is a population of elderly  residents located in a particularly high-hazard area? Are  other services such as gas stations, supermarkets, data  server facilitates, critical hospital care units, pharmacies,  churches, emergency command centers, shelters, public  works facilities, and fire stations located in vulnerable  locations? (iii) Identify ownership. Add information about who  owns or has responsibility for each feature listed. Exam- ple: Senior population may live in retirement communities  (private) or senior housing (public). (iv) Identify each feature as vulnerability or strength.  Assign each listed feature with V or S, or both. Examples of Vulnerabilities:   Senior housing without back-up generators during heat waves.  Residents without access transportation during hurricane evacuation.  Household contaminate and sewage mobilization during flooding.  Limited areas of refuge in elementary schools during tornados. Examples of Strengths:   Reliable communications protocols across departments for all employees.  Neighbor-helping-neighbor program aligned with emergency operations.  Well-supported volunteer organizations (fire, ambulance, CERTs).  Faith-based and civic groups with hazard preparedness plans. C Identify Community Vulnerabilities and Strengths Triggering Questions:  What are the population characteristics of the people living in high-risk  areas? Elderly, low/moderate income, special needs, languages spoken?  What are the strengths and vulnerabilities of people in your community?  Active civic groups, organizations, associations; full-time police, fire,  and emergency medical services; strong lines of communication for  emergency information?  How can hazards intensify these characteristics? Where are areas for improvement in the community?", "1640": "Identify environmental vulnerabilities and strengths (small teams). Cataloguing the vulnerabilities and strengths of natural systems can be complex. Existing factors such as pollution, haphaz- ard development/redevelopment, and invasive species can reduce the ability of natural systems to respond and assist with  hazard impact reduction. Previous and ongoing open-space protection in high-risk areas (i.e., unstable slopes, low-lying  floodplains) is viewed as a strength that often directly increases community resilience. Other benefits of natural systems  to communities include flood storage, recreation, tourism, elevated property values, cooling during heat waves, and water  filtration, among others. Understanding these factors can help facilitate collaborative approaches between development and  conservation that fosters community resilience building. 3 (i) List environmental features. On the Risk Matrix,  list environmental features. Consider natural resources  that are vulnerable to hazards or that can provide  protection for people, property, and amenities from  top hazards. Refer to Triggering Questions to accel- erate dialogue. (ii) Describe locations via participatory mapping. For  each feature, describe the location. Be as specific as  possible. Legibly mark the location on the community  basemap provided. Example: Identify where wetlands  are in relation to current development (e.g., marinas,  road crossings, fire stations, historic building, ceme- teries, neighborhoods, nursing homes, etc.). (iii) Identify ownership. Add information about who  owns or has responsibility for each feature listed.  Examples:   Local beach with boat ramp owned by city.   Nature preserve owned by local land trust.   Grassland and forest owned by federal agency.   Floodplain privately owned by farm. (iv) Identify feature as vulnerability or strength. Assign each listed feature with V or S, or both. Examples of Vulnerabilities:   Beachfront development reducing protection provided by dunes.  Proliferation of subdivisions in wildfire and flood prone areas.  Lack of urban tree canopy increasing heat island effects. Examples of Strengths:   Oyster reefs and tidal wetlands help reduce wave damage to property.  Forested watersheds maintain drinking water supply during droughts.  Native, vegetated slopes remain stable after intense 24-hour rain events.  Floodplains provide stormwater storage and downstream flood reduction. C Identify Community Vulnerabilities and Strengths Triggering Questions:  What natural resources are important to your community?  What benefits do these natural resources provide (storm buffering, fire breaks,  erosion control, water quality improvement, slope stabilization, recreation)?  Which natural resources are exposed to current and future hazards?  What have been the effects of these hazards on these natural resources?  Where are the high-risk areas and what vulnerabilities exist for the  environment?", "1641": "Identify and prioritize infrastructural actions. 1 More examples of actions:  Improved access in high-risk locations  Reduce housing stock in vulnerable areas  Prioritize development in low-risk areas  Integrate future risks in capital  improvement plans  Flood-proof manhole covers  Secure new generators for critical facilities When prioritizing, consider factors such as:  Funding availability and terms  Agreement on outstanding impacts from recent  hazard events  Necessity for advancing longer-term outcomes  Contribution towards meeting existing local  and regional planning objectives Examples of urgency:  Current project to install hurricane-proof  roof on school is an ongoing (O) action.

Harmony with Nature: Ensure that the contributions of  natural resources to human well-being are explicitly rec- ognized and valued and that maintaining their health is a  primary objective. 3. Resilient Economy: Ensure that the community is pre- pared to deal with both positive and negative changes in  its economic health and to initiate sustainable urban de- velopment and redevelopment strategies that foster green  business growth and build reliance on local assets.  4. Interwoven Equity: Ensure fairness and equity in provid- ing for the housing, services, health, safety, and livelihood  needs of all citizens and groups. 5. Healthy Community: Ensure that public health needs are  recognized and addressed through provisions for healthy  foods, physical activity, access to recreation, health care,  environmental justice, and safe neighborhoods. 6. Responsible Regionalism: Ensure that all local proposals  account for, connect with, and support the plans of adja- cent jurisdictions and the surrounding region. Processes are planning activities that take place during  the preparation of a comprehensive plan and define how it  will be implemented. The two processes are: 7. Authentic Participation: Ensure that the planning pro- cess actively involves all segments of the community in  analyzing issues, generating visions, developing plans,  and monitoring outcomes. 8. Accountable Implementation: Ensure that responsibilities  for carrying out the plan are clearly stated, along with met- rics for evaluating progress in achieving desired outcomes. Attributes are plan-making design standards that shape  the content and characteristics of comprehensive plans. The  two attributes are: 9. Consistent Content: Ensure that the plan contains a con- sistent set of visions, goals, policies, objectives, and actions  that are based on evidence about community conditions,  major issues, and impacts. 10. Coordinated Characteristics: Ensure that the plan in- cludes creative and innovative strategies and recommen- dations and coordinates them internally with each other,  vertically with federal and state requirements, and hori- zontally with plans of adjacent jurisdictions", "1651": "Resilience: The increasing frequency and impacts of natural  disasters, as well as severe economic downturns, have high- lighted the need for communities to become more resilient in other words, they need the ability to recover from distur- bance and change.", "1652": "Adaptation: Conditions that used to be considered stable, such  as the climate, resource availability and costs, and the local em- ployment base, are increasingly subject to forces beyond the con- trol of local governments. Such uncertainties call for an adap- tive approach that uses monitoring and feedback mechanisms (a  form of systems thinking) to adjust implementation programs  on an ongoing basis.", "1653": "plementation. For example, the Authentic Participation  Process states that planning should actively involve all  segments of the community in analyzing issues, generat- ing visions, developing plans, and monitoring outcomes.  An example of a best practice for meeting the Authentic  Participation Process is to seek diverse participation in  plan making.", "1654": " Attributes are plan-making design standards that shape  the content and characteristics of comprehensive plans.  For example, the Consistent Content Attribute states that  the plan should contain a consistent set of visions, goals,  policies, objectives, and actions that are based upon evi- dence about community conditions as well as major is- sues and impacts. An example of a best practice for meet- ing the Consistent Content Attribute is to identify major  strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the  community.", "1655": " Best Practices are the planning action tools employed by  communities to activate the desired principles, process- es, and attributes of their comprehensive plans. They are  analogous to the bodys muscles and tendons, linking and  moving the components of the planning structure. Based  on state-of-the-art practices found in leading plans and  planning literature, they represent the best thinking of  the planning profession on how to carry out the visions  and goals of their plans. Complete definitions of these best  practices are provided in Appendix B.", "1656": " Principles are normative statements of intent that under- lie a plans overall strategy, including its goals, objectives,  policies, maps, and other content. In the framework, each  principle is activated by a number of specific best practices  for sustainability. For example, the Interwoven Equity  Principle states that the plan goals and policies should  ensure fairness and equity in providing for the housing,  services, health, safety, and livelihood needs of all citizens  and groups. An example of a best practice for meeting the  Interwoven Equity Principle is to provide affordable and  workforce housing.", "1657": " Processes are planning activities that take place during  the preparation of a comprehensive plan and define how  it will be carried outpublic participation and plan im-", "1658": "1. Livable Built Environment Ensure that all elements of the built environment, including  land use, transportation, housing, energy, and infrastruc- ture, work together to provide sustainable, green places for  living, working, and recreation, with a high quality of life. The built environment encompasses physical features  (such as buildings, streets, and utilities) and the systems and  processes associated with them (such as movement of people,  flow of water). As such, it defines the multifaceted community  that people experience through their daily livesthe places  where they live, work, and recreate. Because the built environ- ment shapes quality of life for the entire population, sustain- ing its livability and ensuring that it functions at the highest  possible level are primary tasks for comprehensive planning.  Traditional comprehensive plans typically treat the different  components of the built environment as separate elements,  such as land use and transportation. However, the built en- vironment is a complex system made up of many interacting  and dynamic elements, and planners face ongoing challenges  in sustaining and coordinating the overall system as well as  its component parts. By virtue of its scope and mandate, the  comprehensive plan is the logical tool for an integrated sys- tems approach to ensuring a livable built environment.", "1659": "Best practices in support of the Livable Built Envi- ronment principle include the following (see Appendix B  for definitions): 1.1 Plan for multimodal transportation. 1.2 Plan for transit-oriented development. 1.3 Coordinate regional transportation investments  with job clusters. 1.4 Provide complete streets serving multiple functions. 1.5 Plan for mixed land-use patterns that are walkable  and bikeable. 1.6 Plan for infill development. 1.7 Encourage design standards appropriate to the  community context. 1.8 Provide accessible public facilities and spaces. 1.9 Conserve and reuse historic resources. 1.10 Implement green building design and  energy conservation. 1.11 Discourage development in hazard zones.", "1660": "2. Harmony with Nature Ensure that the contributions of natural resources to hu- man well-being are explicitly recognized and valued and  that maintaining their health is a primary objective.", "1661": "The natural environment comprises the earths in- terrelated systems of air, water, soil, and vegetation and  their ongoing processes. Human well-being depends upon  a healthy natural environment to provide the services of  nourishing food, breathable air, drinkable water, haz- ard protection, energy, and spiritual sustenance. Because  urban development and human activities can disturb  natures balance and damage the resources it provides,  comprehensive plans and implementation programs must  monitor the health of and mitigate negative impacts to the  natural environment. A healthy environment is a common  resource that belongs to everyone but is owned by no one.  Therefore, the community through its plan must advocate  for, and present the value of, the contributions of natural  systems and services to the triple bottom line (environ- ment, economy, and equity). While some natural resourc- es are protected through separate functional plans, such  as those for air and water quality, the comprehensive plan  is the proper tool for the overall coordination and main- tenance of natural systems within the full community and  regional context. This includes integrating natural features  and processes into the built environment (the Livable Built  Environment principle).", "1662": "Best practices in support of the Harmony with Nature  principle include the following (see Appendix B for definitions): 2.1 Restore, connect, and protect natural habitats  and sensitive lands. 2.2 Plan for the provision and protection of  green infrastructure. 2.3 Encourage development that respects  natural topography. 2.4 Enact policies to reduce carbon footprints. 2.5 Comply with state and local air quality standards. 2.6 Encourage climate change adaptation. 2.7 Provide for renewable energy use. 2.8 Provide for solid waste reduction. 2.9 Encourage water conservation and plan for a last- ing water supply. 2.10 Protect and manage streams, watersheds, and  floodplains.", "1663": "3. Resilient Economy Ensure that the community is prepared to deal with both  positive and negative changes in its economic health and  to initiate sustainable urban development and redevelop- ment strategies that foster green business growth and build  reliance on local assets.  ", "1664": "The communitys economy is made up of the businesses,  trades, productive facilities, and related activities that provide  the livelihoods of the population. Economic health is critical  in providing jobs and incomes to support the community; as  it rises or falls, so do the livelihoods of people. Because local  economies depend upon outside (regional, national, and even  global) inputs and trends, their employment base is affected  not only by local business formation and activity but also by  the decisions of distant firms or governments. Therefore, more  reliance on local assets increases the economic resilience of  the community, as well as contributing to place-based revi- talization. Because some productive activities generate nega- tive impacts, green businesses (such as solar-powered energy  systems) may be preferable to those with greater impacts  and can reduce reliance on outside resources (imported fos- sil fuels, for example). Although some communities develop  and implement separate economic development strategies,  the comprehensive plan provides the instrument for placing  those strategies within the context of the broader community  development agenda.", "1665": "Best practices in support of the Resilient Economy prin- ciple include the following (see Appendix B for definitions): 3.1 Provide the physical capacity for economic growth. 3.2 Plan for a balanced land-use mix for  fiscal sustainability. 3.3 Plan for transportation access to  employment centers. 3.4 Promote green businesses and jobs. 3.5 Encourage community-based economic  development and revitalization. 3.6 Provide and maintain infrastructure capacity in line  with growth or decline demands. 3.7 Plan for post-disaster economic recovery.", "1666": "4. Interwoven Equity  Ensure fairness and equity in providing for the housing,  services, health, safety, and livelihood needs of all citizens  and groups. Equity in the provision of community decisions and  services involves the fair distribution of benefits and  costs. It results from applying basic fairness tests that  ask whether the needs of the full range of the popula- tion servedrich and poor, young and old, native and  immigrantare served. Because disadvantaged, young,  or immigrant populations often do not participate in de- bates over community policies and programs, their needs ", "1667": "may fail to be recognized. Poor, underserved, and minor- ity populations are often disproportionately affected by  polluting land uses and natural disasters. Because such  populations may not have the skills or community con- nections necessary for access to jobs, economic resourc- es, and health care, the community may have to provide  special programs to assist them. Decent, affordable hous- ing is another critical need that falls under this princi- ple. By weaving equity questions into the comprehensive  plan, the community and its government can ensure the  consideration of who benefits as it develops its policies,  priorities, and expenditures.", "1668": "Best practices in support of the Interwoven Equity prin- ciple include the following (see Appendix B for definitions): 4.1 Provide a range of housing types. 4.2 Plan for a jobs/housing balance. 4.3 Plan for the physical, environmental, and economic  improvement of at-risk, distressed, and disadvan- taged neighborhoods. 4.4 Plan for improved health and safety for  at-risk populations. 4.5 Provide accessible, quality public services,  facilities, and health care to minority and low- income populations. 4.6 Upgrade infrastructure and facilities in older and  substandard areas. 4.7 Plan for workforce diversity and development. 4.8 Protect vulnerable populations from  natural hazards. 4.9 Promote environmental justice.", "1669": "5. Healthy Community  Ensure that public health needs are recognized and ad- dressed through provisions for healthy foods, physical ac- tivity, access to recreation, health care, environmental jus- tice, and safe neighborhoods. The World Health Organization defines health as a  state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and  not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. The Healthy  Community principle and the previous four principles work  together to support the mission of public health: to fulfill  societys interest in assuring conditions in which people can  be healthy (Institute of Medicine 1988). In a healthy com- munity, residents are assured that the air and water are safe,  open space and recreation are convenient to use, local food  outlets are located near neighborhoods, public schools and  ", "1670": "access to health care are provided equitably, and active pub- lic safety programs are in place. Because the normal opera- tions of the private economic market may not ensure that  these common public benefits are uniformly available, it  may be necessary for the government to fill the gaps. For  example, disadvantaged neighborhoods are often located in  unsafe or unhealthy areas of the community, such as brown- fields or floodplains, and public programs may be needed to  address these locational hazards. The comprehensive plan  is the appropriate tool for identifying and mitigating public  health hazards, and for promoting effective healthy com- munity goals.", "1671": "Best practices in support of the Healthy Commu- nity principle include the following (see Appendix B for  definitions): 5.1 Reduce exposure to toxins and pollutants  in the natural and built environments. 5.2 Plan for increased public safety through reduction  of crime and injuries. 5.3 Plan for the mitigation and redevelopment of  brownfields for productive uses. 5.4 Plan for physical activity and healthy lifestyles. 5.5 Provide accessible parks, recreation facilities, green- ways, and open space near all neighborhoods. 5.6 Plan for access to healthy, locally grown foods for  all neighborhoods. 5.7 Plan for equitable access to health care provid- ers, schools, public safety facilities, and arts and  cultural facilities.", "1672": ". Responsible Regionalism  Ensure that all local proposals account for, connect with,  and support the plans of adjacent jurisdictions and the sur- rounding region. Regional planning agencies, although typically without  regulatory authority, provide perspectives broad enough to  encompass the scope of various regional systems, such as  transportation and water supply, which extend beyond lo- cal jurisdictional boundaries. As authorized by federal sur- face transportation legislation, transportation planning is  the core responsibility of designated metropolitan planning  agencies (MPOs). Increasingly, progressive MPOs and other  regional planning agencies are addressing other issues with  regional implications, such as open space and environmen- tal protection, housing, economic development, utility infra- structure, and hazard mitigation. Because regional agencies ", "1673": "coordinate the activities of groups of local governments, they  provide an institutional setting for joint decision making that  transcends local politics. From the local governmental per- spective, the plans and policies of adjacent jurisdictions have  reciprocal impacts, in terms of factors such as the location  of new development, commuting patterns, and stormwater  flows. Therefore, connecting these plans and policies through  the comprehensive plan is a way to understand and manage  these and other overlapping functions, such as regional gre- enway systems, and to responsibly integrate a communitys  plan with those of its neighbors.", "1674": "Best practices in support of the Responsible Region- alism principle include the following (see Appendix B for  definitions): 6.1 Coordinate local land-use plans with regional  transportation investments. 6.2 Coordinate local and regional housing plan goals. 6.3 Coordinate local open space plans with regional  green infrastructure plans. 6.4 Delineate designated growth areas that are served  by transit. 6.5 Promote regional cooperation and sharing of  resources. 6.6 Enhance connections between local activity centers  and regional destinations. 6.7 Coordinate local and regional population and  economic projections. 6.8 Include regional development visions and plans in  local planning scenarios. 6.9 Encourage consistency between local capital im- provement programs and regional infrastructure  priorities.", "1675": "7. Authentic Participation  Ensure that the planning process actively involves all seg- ments of the community in analyzing issues, generating vi- sions, developing plans, and monitoring outcomes. Public participation in planning is a mainstay of demo- cratic governance and decision making. By actively involving  the whole community in making and implementing plans, the  government fulfills its responsibilities to keep all citizens in- formed and to offer them the opportunity to influence those  actions that affect them. In the past, public participation  processes did not necessarily reach all segments of the com- munity and may have been viewed by public agencies more  as a requirement to meet (for example, by conducting public  hearings) than as an opportunity to garner meaningful input.  This means that authentic participation processes may have to  overcome the perception that what participants say will not be  respected. Authentic participation programs go beyond the  minimum legal requirements to connect with citizens through  innovative communication and outreach channels, such as  creative use of the Internet and interactive workshops in loca- tions where people work and live. The comprehensive planning  process is an ideal vehicle for opening all stages of plan making  to the public, from early issue analysis to finalizing and imple- menting the plan.", "1676": "Best practices in support of the Authentic Participation  process include the following (see Appendix B for definitions): 7.1 Engage stakeholders at all stages of the  planning process. 7.2 Seek diverse participation in the planning process. 7.3 Promote leadership development in disadvantaged  communities through the planning process. 7.4 Develop alternative scenarios of the future. 7.5 Provide ongoing and understandable information  for all participants. 7.6 Use a variety of communications channels to in- form and involve the community. 7.7 Continue to engage the public after the  comprehensive plan is adopted.", "1677": "8. Accountable Implementation Ensure that responsibilities for carrying out the plan are  clearly stated, along with metrics for evaluating progress in  achieving desired outcomes.", "1678": "Implementation is the set of actions that carry out the  proposals of the comprehensive plan over time. Account- able implementation ties these actions to defined time- tables, activities, budgets, and agencies; reports their ef- fectiveness to the public; and revises the plan based on the  reported findings. Traditional comprehensive plans have  been subject to criticism because they do not connect goals  and policies to actual implementation, with the possible  exception of revising zoning and development regula- tions. By contrast, accountable implementation weaves the  plan into the daily activities of the local jurisdiction and  its various departments, including budgeting and capital  program funding. The most effective programs reach out- side the local government to engage partners in the public,  private, and nonprofit sectors in implementation. Because  the public is often unaware of the effectiveness of actions  taken to carry out the plan, an accountable implementa- tion program establishes and regularly publishes metrics  that report on progress; the relevant adage is what gets  measured, gets done. While some metrics and progress  reports are made at the program or operational level,  the comprehensive plan is the right place to establish the  connection between adopted goals and actual outcomes  through local governmental activities.", "1679": "Best practices in support of the Accountable Imple- mentation process include the following (see Appendix B  for definitions): 8.1 Indicate specific actions for implementation. 8.2 Connect plan implementation to the capital  planning process. 8.3 Connect plan implementation to the annual  budgeting process. 8.4 Establish interagency and organizational cooperation. 8.5 Identify funding sources for plan implementation. 8.6 Establish implementation indicators, benchmarks,  and targets. 8.7 Regularly evaluate and report on  implementation progress. 8.8 Adjust the plan as necessary based on the evaluation.", "1680": "9. Consistent Content  Ensure that the plan contains a consistent set of visions, goals,  policies, objectives, and actions that are based on evidence  about community conditions, major issues, and impacts. Plan content includes the basic features of the plan,  their purposes, how they are devised, and how they are  blended into a coordinated, compelling, and consistent  comprehensive plan document. Every plan should be based  on a careful assessment of community needs and condi- tions, a candid evaluation of strengths and weaknesses, a  future vision, and goals, policies, and actions to achieve  the vision. Because plans tend to include many policies and  goals, some of which may be in conflict, it is important to  assess the consistency of the proposed policy set to ensure  there are no irreconcilable differences. Plans deal with ma- jor community issues and impactssome of which may be  controversialand so are subject to close scrutiny. There- fore, their proposals must be supported with solid evidence.  The comprehensive plan is the appropriate platform to in- tegrate and adopt the visions, goals, actions, and evidence  into a consistent and logical statement of community intent  for future development.", "1681": "Best practices in support of the Consistent Content at- tribute include the following (see Appendix B for definitions): 9.1 Assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. 9.2 Establish a fact base. 9.3. Develop a vision of the future. 9.4 Set goals in support of the vision. 9.5 Set objectives in support of the goals. 9.6 Set polices to guide decision making. 9.7 Define actions to carry out the plan. 9.8 Use clear and compelling features to present the plan.", "1682": "10. Coordinated Characteristics Ensure that the plan includes creative and innovative  strategies and recommendations and coordinates them  internally with each other, vertically with federal and  state requirements, and horizontally with plans of ad- jacent jurisdictions. Plan characteristics are the identifying features of the  planits unique blend of strategies and coordinated rec- ommendations, as well as its linkages to intergovernmental  plans and requirements. Innovative plans are character- ized by creative approaches and problem-solving strate- gies that seek new solutions to contemporary challenges,  as well as new formats that better communicate proposals  to the public. The plan must include broader connections  because communities must recognize and conform with  many federal and state requirements and because com- munities have crosscutting relationships with neighbor- ing communities. Traditional comprehensive plans often  are not widely read because they are too long and contain  too much planning jargon. Therefore, it is important to  translate plans into concise, easily readable, and under- standable contentincluding not only text and tables, but  also maps, graphics, and digital images. Advances in tech- nology and communications techniques make it possible  to create comprehensive plans that are more interesting,  attractive, and accessible.", "1683": "Best practices in support of the Coordinated Content at- tribute include the following (see Appendix B for definitions): 10.1 Be comprehensive in the plans coverage. 10.2 Integrate the plan with other local plans and pro- grams. 10.3 Be innovative in the plans approach. 10.4 Be persuasive in the plans communications. 10.5 Be consistent across plan components. 10.6 Coordinate with the plans of other jurisdictions  and levels of government. 10.7 Comply with applicable laws and mandates. 10.8 Be transparent in the plans substance. 10.9 Use plan formats that go beyond paper.", "1684": "Scoring Criteria: Best Practices for Principles  (Livable Built Environment, Harmony with  Nature, Resilient Economy, Interwoven Equity,  Healthy Community, Responsible Regionalism)  Not Applicable: assigned only if it can be demonstrated  that community conditions or legal constraints prevent  the use of the practice. Since they are subtracted from  the overall potential plan score total, Not Applicable  scores do not penalize the plan rating.  Not Present (0 points): assigned if the practice is ap- plicable but not referenced or included in the plan. Not  Present scores do reduce the plan rating.  Low (1 point): assigned if the practice is mentioned in  the plan at a basic level, but is not carried further. Example: A plan that mentions a green infrastructure  network (practice 2.2) as a goal but does not address it  in the plan policies, strategies, or implementation.  Medium (2 points): assigned if the practice is discussed  in the narrative, goals, and policies of the plan, but is  not carried forward to implementation steps. Example: A plan that has a goal and policy related to  a green infrastructure network (practice 2.2) but does ", "1685": "not define the components of the network and how it is  to be implemented.

Not Present (0 points): assigned if the process practice  is not addressed in the plan.  Low (1 point): assigned if the process practice is men- tioned in the plan, with no supporting data, analysis, or  other documentation provided. Examples: A plan that mentions including stakeholders  in the planning process (practice 7.1) but provides no  documentation of having done so, or a plan that men- tions strategies for implementing plan goals and objec- tives (practice 8.1) but provides no direction on how  this is to be done.  Medium (2 points): assigned if the process practice is  discussed to some degree in the plan, with minimal sup- porting data, analysis, or other documentation provided. Examples: A plan that generally describes how stake- holder participation was used in the planning process  (practice 7.1) but does not document how this partici- pation informed the plan implementation program, or  a plan that ties implementation strategies (practice 8.1)  to plan goals and objectives but does not provide detail  on how these strategies are to be implemented (e.g., re- sponsible parties and timeframes).  High (3 points): assigned if the process practice is fully  addressed and completely defined in the plan, with sup- porting data, analysis, or other documentation provided. Examples: A plan that documents how stakeholders  were involved in the planning process (practice 7.1) and  how their involvement is reflected in the implementa- tion program (e.g., assignment of responsibilities for  action) or a plan that clearly demonstrates the connec- tion from plan goals and objectives to implementation", "1687": "Scoring Criteria: Best Practices for Attributes  (Consistent Content and Coordinated  Characteristics)  Not Applicable: unlikely to be assigned for attribute  evaluation since all plans must address the basic con- tent and characteristic practices.  Not Present (0 points): assigned if the attribute practice  is not addressed in the plan.  Low (1 point): assigned if the attribute practice is mini- mally addressed in the plan based on data, analysis,  written and graphic communication, or other demon- strable form of support. Examples: A plan that mentions major issues facing the  community (practice 9.1) without providing support- ing analysis (such as forecast trends and planning im- plications), or a plan that contains standard or required  comprehensive plan elements (practice 10.1) but does  not indicate how these elements comprehensively ad- dress the characteristics and issues of the community.  Medium (2 points): assigned if the attribute practice is  moderately addressed in the plan based on data, analy- sis, written and graphic communication, or other de- monstrable form of support. Examples: A plan that identifies major issues facing the  community (practice 9.1) and provides some degree  of supporting analysis (e.g., general trends and plan- ning implications), or a plan that covers multiple topics  beyond standard or required comprehensive plan ele- ments (practice 10.1), with some indication as to how  these topics comprehensively address the characteris- tics and issues of the community.  High (3 points): assigned if the attribute practice is fully  addressed in the plan based on data, analysis, written  and graphic communication, or other demonstrable  form of support.  Examples: A plan that articulates major issues facing  the community (practice 9.1) with robust supporting  analysis (e.g., forecast trends and planning implica- tions), or a plan that covers multiple topics beyond  standard or required comprehensive plan elements  (practice 10.1), addresses how these topics interrelate,  and demonstrates how they comprehensively address  the characteristics and issues of the community.", "1688": "Step One: Discuss the Standards Framework The first step is to develop a community understanding of the  plan standards framework and its components. By reading  and discussing the materials in this report, a community can  ", "1689": "decide if the framework can be helpful in preparing or revis- ing its comprehensive plan.  Planning staff can take the lead by circulating the stan- dards framework to planning boards, government officials,  and interested stakeholder groups. In doing so, they can ar- range forums, discussion sessions, and other opportunities  for facilitating conversations about community sustainabil- ity and the potential for using the framework to strengthen  the comprehensive plan. Staff can facilitate this discussion  ", "1690": "by preparing slides, web presentations, and other types of  educational materials. These can be illustrated with examples  from communities that have adopted plans aimed at improv- ing sustainability, such as the plans analyzed in Sustaining  Places: The Role of the Comprehensive Plan (Godschalk and  Anderson 2012) and those prepared by the pilot communities  involved in this Plan Standards project (see Appendix A for a  listing of plan websites). To simplify the task of reviewing the comprehensive frame- work content and to enhance understanding of the value of the  framework, planners could lead small group discussions on in- dividual principles or groups of principles. These could have the  benefit of illustrating more concretely how the standards might  apply to problems or needs specific to the community. This  would lead naturally to step two, which is to think about changes  or improvements to the local plan and planning process.", "1691": "Where are the gaps in the plan? Reviewers should  look for important areas that have been overlooked in past  planning efforts. This is especially important to ensure that  contemporary issuessuch as climate change and commu- nity resiliencehave been addressed, and that contemporary  objectivessuch as community health, safety, and social eq- uityhave been incorporated into the plan.", "1692": "Is the planning database credible? The standards as- sume that comprehensive plan strategies are built on solid  and up-to-date factual evidence. Compilation and analysis  of planning databases should provide an accurate picture  of existing and projected community conditions. In cur- rent times of evolving and dynamic data on trends such as  climate change, economic instability, and environmental  degradation, the maintenance and regular updating of the  plans fact base are especially important.", "1693": "Does the participation process operate on a continu- ing community-wide basis? The standards assume that all  stakeholders will be involved, not just the dedicated group  that shows up for every meeting. They assume that the plan- ning staff will make full use of all channels of communica- tion, including social media, in generating two-way partici- pation. To maintain trust in the local government and its  planning, transparency is vital. Applying process practices  will illuminate issues and point out needed fixes in the in- volvement program.", "1694": "Does the plan contain solid provisions for monitoring  outcomes and evaluating implementation? The standards  assume a conscious and continuing effort to see that plan rec- ommendations are carried out. This is important not only on  the basis of efficiency and effectiveness in deploying commu- nity resources, but also on the basis of informing the public  about the degree to which plan objectives have been realized.  It is also important in terms of keeping plans current and fo- cused on critical priorities. Once these questions have been answered, it will be pos- sible to proceed to the next step, which is to begin to incorpo- rate the applicable standards into the new or existing plan to  respond to the objectives of the standards framework.", "1695": "Step Three: Incorporate Applicable Standards The third step is to incorporate the applicable standards  into the plan and planning process. Depending on the  local situation, this may be a relatively simple process of  adding some best practices or it may be a more complex  process of rethinking the plan. Because each communi- ty will have a different local context, it is not possible to  outline a singular planning process that is relevant to all  communities. However, the experience of the pilot com- munities can offer some guidance. As described later in  this chapter, they used the standards in different ways, de- pending upon the local context and stage of preparation of  their comprehensive plans. Once the plan has been prepared or updated, the fi- nal step is to conduct an overall evaluation using the plan  standards framework. This evaluation presently can only", "1696": "take the form of an internal scoring process; if the external  review and designation program described in Appendix D  is instituted, then communities could apply for such out- side designation.  ", "1697": "Step Four: Score the Plan The fourth step is to score the plan against the standards.  The benefit of this scoring is to provide an indication of the  degree to which the plan takes a comprehensive approach  to sustaining places. By assessing the level of achievement  for the practices in the standards, reviewers will be able to  judge the overall quality of the plan. As mentioned earlier,  this assessment may be done internally within the com- munity to generate a comparative benchmark of the plans  achievement versus the full slate of possible best practices.  In the future, it may also be offered through an external re- view and designation process (see Appendix D). This report  focuses on internal scoring. As noted in Chapter 2, the scoring approach involves as- signing a rating of Not Applicable, Not Present, Low, Medi- um, or High to a plans incorporation of each practice in the  standards framework. To assist planners in scoring, a matrix  has been prepared with brief descriptions of the practices as- sociated with each principle, process, and attribute. A copy of  this matrix is located in Appendix C. To ensure that the scoring is accurate as possible, a  team of at least two planners knowledgeable about the  plans structure and content should carry out the scoring  separately. Once each team member has read and scored the  plan, they can meet to identify and discuss differences in  scoring, including any judgment calls made about the level  at which a particular practice should be scored. This should  be continued until the team is able to come to consensus on  the scoring. What will the final scores tell communities? The scores  will identify any areas where the plan departs from the level  of plan quality set forth in the standards framework. They  will highlight areas of strength and areas where further im- provement may be warranted. If a plan has a high overall  score, then a community can be assured that they are staking  their future sustainability on a strong planning foundation. If  it has a low overall score, then this can help a community un- derstand the need to invest further resources in its planning  program. As noted in the pilot community examples pro- vided below, scoring a plan is a useful diagnostic procedure,  which may turn up previously undiscovered gaps. It can also  be used as a prescriptive process, which will suggest remedies  for filling the gaps.", "1698": "The Guides working definition of sustainability is: A communitys ongoing capacity and resolve to work together  to establish, advance, and maintain effective strategies that continuously improve health and quality of life for a", "1699": "For simplicitys sake, we will be referring primarily to your coalitiona collection of individuals and organiza- tions working together to achieve specifics goals.

Such a plan can en- able it to diversify or expand the scope of its policy strategy goals, funding, and membership. In general, this  broader plan will require a review and possible expansion of mission and vision statements, organizational  structure, policy-strategy goals, objectives, activities, resource development, and timeline for completion. It  can also require making connections with more community leaders and partners, if that has not happened  already.  ", "1702": "STEP 1CREATE A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF SUSTAINABILITY  Creating a shared understanding of what sustainability means to your coali- tion and other key community stakeholders will make planning for sustain- ability easier (Friedman & Wicklund, 2006). Think about it as part of your core  efforts, if you havent already. Successful long-term planning also depends on  having a clear picture of a long-term mission and vision that includes aspects  of your coalitions structure or policy strategies that should be maintained or  improved (Lasker & Weiss, 2003). Consider expanding your definition around  sustainability to include the efforts of like-minded partners and organiza- tions; it may be work that they are already doing. However coalition members  decide to proceed, consider the following suggestions:   Determine what type of organization will best suit the needs of the  coalition for the long run (For more information see Module 3. Estab- lishing a Home for Healthy Communities Work on page 71). Organize  your coalition structure and communication strategies to help achieve  your objectives.   Be clear about what sustainability means in the context of coalition  policy strategies and activities.   Agree (earlier rather than later) that planning for sustainability is  valuable.    Include multiple community stakeholders in the sustainability  planning process.  ", "1703": "Coordinator: The process coordinator helps to ensure that the sustainability planning timeline is realistic and  appropriate, appropriate people are involved and engaged in the process, meetings occur as planned, internal  and external communications are effective, and action steps are implemented. ", "1704": "Facilitator: If financially feasible, consider contracting with an outside resource to help facilitate some planning  meetings. Some points in this process (e.g., Steps 6 and 8) require difficult decisions, such as de-prioritizing  a policy strategy that someone in the planning group values, reducing staffing levels, or working through a  tough political situation. Using an outside (and potentially more objective) facilitator may help reduce conflict  and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate.", "1705": "Planning Team: Forming a separate planning team focused  on sustainability allows the coalition to focus on policy  strategies already underway for sustaining change in sys- tems and environments, as well as capacity-building efforts  that the coalition is trying to continue (Kansas University  Work Group, 2010). This team should be responsible for  discussing relevant issues, making decisions, and ultimately  implementing the sustainability plan. While the size of this  team is whatever best suits your coalition, remember that  demands for internal communication and staff support  increase as the number of people involved in the planning  process increases. To ensure that your effort is valued in the  community, consider inviting (or solicit input from) key external representatives from:    Community officials (e.g., from city hall or the local transportation authority)   Businesses or corporations   Nonprofit organizations or foundations   Other groups (e.g., faith-based, recreation, neighborhood homeowner associations)   Local, regional, and state policy-making groups", "1706": "Which internal stakeholders are involvedand how you involve themis up to you, as long as they meet the  needs of your coalitions planning effort and overall strategic goals. They might include:   Executive or steering committee members    Coalition coordinators and project managers    Staff and volunteers", "1707": "How Long Will It Take? Its a good idea to start the sustainability planning process as soon as possible.  Identifying and agreeing on a process, including a timetable is very important. When developing your time- line, consider the size and technological capacity (e.g., e-mail, Web access, use of social media) of your group.  Try to ensure that each members role in the group properly reflects his or her skills, interests, and resources.  And decide when in-person meetings are essential and when virtual meetings can be used instead.", "1708": "Start by identifying what your coalition is already doing to plan for sustainability; some of these strategies  might already be in your coalitions community action plan (CAP).", "1709": "Think about current and future goals and factors such as infrastructure, operational practices, and financial re- sources needed to support those goals. (For a full list of other factors to consider, see Activity B in the Appen- dix on page 88). Assess partner relationships that support coalition efforts and identify those you may want to  develop. For coalitions just beginning their plan, ask members, external stakeholders, local groups, and com- munity members to fill out a connection mapa catalog of existing and potential community connections.  (See the HCC example on page 21). When looking for support and resources (e.g., funding, in-kind support,  people) to help achieve and sustain organizational or policy goals, consider using all or some of the assets and  connections available. Then review the maps with appropriate individuals to find any potential sustainability  connections; they may be willing to make the initial contact for you. (Be sure you get prior approval to use  any newly established connections). If youre not sure what a new organization can bring to the table, find the  right people from that organization and interview them to determine their interests and potential resources.  Another way to use the maps is to identify gaps among particular groups in the community.

Then list pending items/up- coming events (e.g., pending funding, policy changes, new initiatives) that can  impact continuation of those efforts. Work with members outside the planning  team to ensure that youve included all pending items. It might also be help- ful to list other community efforts that could complement or duplicate your  coalition strategies and activities. Finally, if you havent already, discuss how all  these factors influence the current organizational structure and the potential  for achieving future policy strategies, goals, objectives, or activities. This analy- sis can help your coalition leverage funding and partnershipswhich, in turn,  positively impacts sustainability succes", "1722": "Focus on Money or Effort? These important issues are linked. Most groups begin to work on sustainability because a funding source is  ending. They often focus so much on replacing that funding, they dont question whether or not the policy  strategy is worth sustaining (St. Leger, 2005). What is its value? Does it have community buy-in and support?  Do leaders see its outcome as important? Conversely, have effective policy strategies been successfully imple- mented and no longer need your groups attention? Or do existing strategies need monitoring or enforcing? In  addition, are there funders who will support your objectives? Do you have a case statement to promote your  efforts? Asking these questions before beginning sustainability discussions can help lead to informed choices  about whether a policy strategy and activity should be continued and, if so, in what form.  When developing these criteria, consider your coalitions mission and vision, how the group is structured and  supported, as well as the long-term goal of each of your policy efforts. The Sustainability Planning Team should  agree on criteria that will help determine the value-added benefit of each effort, and select those for which  data are available.  Potential criteria include: available resources (financial, organizational, human), level of community support,  evidence of strategy effectiveness, and whether a need still exists for the effort in question. (See Step 5 in the  HCC example on page 25). Determine whether any of these criteria are relevant to your coalitions situation. To  make the rating process easier, consider selecting only 35 of the most important criteria. (For more detailed  instructions on how to use criteria to prioritize activities, see the Activity D Criteria Grid in the Appendix on  page 93). It is also important to ensure a direct relationship between  coalition goals and the supporting objectives and activities.  Objectives should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,  Relevant, and Time-bound). Coalitions should view objectives as  short- or long-term strategies. For example, a coalition can fund  a strategy as part of a demonstration project (short-term) to  successfully make the case for a future policy goal (long-term).  Or, you may fund the development of three community gardens  in underserved areas, but ultimately want to create a policy  distributing garden produce to local food banks in the area on a  regular basis.", "1723": "Evaluation data can help your coalition: improve implementation over time; increase accountability to funders  (now and in the future); promote sustainability, and engage stakeholders. First youll need to choose the best  way of gathering needed datae.g., interviews, focus groups, surveys, site visits? Remember, some of the  evaluation data you use can come from other sources, such as, national and state surveys, and organizational  and historical data. Below are a few evaluation tips to keep in mind throughout the sustainability process.    Develop a logic model that shows how continuing strategies will help improve community outcomes.  For an example of a logic model, see Example 2 in the Appendix on page 98.    Survey coalition members and other relevant decision-makers to determine if your current organiza- tion is helping to make the most of community resources to achieve its goals.    Instead of just counting numbers, explain an efforts return on social investment. For example, show  how strategies might help save lives (Ralser, 2007). In a report by Trust for Americas Health (TFAH),  an investment of $10 per person per year in proven community-based strategies to increase physical  activity, improve nutrition, and prevent smoking and other tobacco use could save the country more  than $16 billion annually within 5 years (Braveman & Egerter, 2008).   Use short-term results to make the case for or support how this strategy will have long-term benefits.    Involve evaluators early in sustainability discussions to provide key data for decision making.   If an effort is based on a similar activity evaluated elsewhere, those findings may help make the case  for your work and sharpen decisions about which activities to continue. Consider using CDCs Commu- nity Health Assessment and Group Evaluation (CHANGE) tool to gain a better picture of current coali- tion activities. (For more information on the CHANGE tool, visit:  www.cdc.gov/healthycommunitiesprogram/tools/change/downloads.htm.)", "1724": "STEP 6DECIDE WHAT TO CONTINUE AND PRIORITIZE  Here are some suggestions for working through this process. Think about using the criteria grid and decision- making process detailed in Step 2. Post categories and efforts on separate places on a wall. Ask team members  to recommend an activity or strategy. If you agree, place it under the appropriate category; if not, set it aside.  Continue until you have discussed each item. Then return to set-aside items and decide whether to continue  each. Proceed until everyone agrees on all efforts. You may modify items that you decide to continue, but  discuss later. Review decisions to ensure that the group is comfortable. If people hesitate, you may need more  discussion. You may have missed key criteria, or some that you selected were over- or undervalued. If so,  return to Step 5; revise your criteria grid by changing the criteria or scale. If you decide to continue most or all  of what you have been doing, prioritize the list to ensure that you can reasonably sustain the strategies and  efforts that the group values the most.", "1725": "What about Revised Strategies? If your coalition has decided which strategies to keep, you should prioritize themputting those most highly  valued firstand then identify key stakeholders to further evaluate the strategies and recommend changes,  if necessary. Once recommendations are offered and revisions are identified, develop an action plan to imple- ment these changes. For more on action plans, see Step 9Implement the Sustainability Plan on page 39.", "1726": "What about Strategies That Are Not Continued? Most likely, some strategies and activities will discontinued for several possible reasons. Some will have been  completed and wont need to be repeated anytime soon (e.g., policy forum). Other activities might still be in  their beginning stages, not having reached their stated strategy goals. Ending or de-prioritizing an activity can  be difficult, especially if people are passionate about it. (Having a skilled, neutral facilitator can be helpful in  this situation). Remember that ending a particular effort is not necessarily a bad thing, because resources can  now be leveraged in a way that is more likely to meet community needs. Relish any small successes that came  from the effort and note what has been learned from it. This will help guide future coalition efforts.  Whatever the reason for de-prioritizing a strategy, the coalition should take steps to formally close it out (e.g.,  completing an evaluation and final report). This way, there will be a record of relevant decisions and actions in  case the strategy is revisited by other organizations seeking to do similar work. (See Activity E in the Appendix  on page 94 to help with these sustainability decisions).", "1727": "Asking Others to Take on Strategies Just because your coalition designed and implemented a policy strategy, it may not necessarily be responsible  for its long-term success or continuation. Coalitions often serve as community laboratories for testing innova- tive strategies; after deciding which should be continued, your coalition may conclude that another group is  better suited to the task. Maybe its not feasible for your coalition to sustain so many strategies and activities  at once, or some dont precisely fit your criteria for continuation (see Step 5). Spinning off strategies to other organizations that will support them in the long run is a solid sustainability  goal (Goodman & Steckler, 1989). Kaiser Permanente developed a guide (see graphic below) to help decide  which strategies from a funding initiative should be sustained or spun off to other organizations.", "1728": "STEP 7CREATE OPTIONS FOR MAINTAINING PRIORITY EFFORTS  After deciding what strategies the coalition will prioritize, think creatively about resource development and  leveraging funding sources. Remember, continuing an effort does not necessarily mean continuing it in the  same way. There are many options for you to explore!  The sustainability planning team should understand the coalitions current funding situation, including all  funding sources and their timeframes. Make sure team members are clear about which efforts they want to  maintain and in what form, without focusing solely on monetary aspects. Facilitate discussions that identify:    Major supporters,   Potential supporters of your efforts,   Potential gaps in funding, and   Where to reallocate existing resources. Strategies for Obtaining Financial Resources Consider different financial strategies that best fit with your coalition  efforts. Think about striking a balance between the time and resources it  takes to secure new funding and to implement existing activities. Look  within the communitycoalition members, an organizations board of  directors, businesses, local foundations, public entities, and other com- munity membersthat may help obtain financial resources. Creating a  resource development committee, hiring fund development staff or an  outside consultant, or engaging in marketing and public relations efforts  also may be helpful. Generally, developing multiple strategies for continu- ing an effort is beneficial (Marek, Mancini, & Brock, 2009). Consider sus- tainability from many angles, such as developing and supporting policy  strategies and having the capacity to develop and sustain community- based coalitions or partnerships to prioritize and achieve policy goals.  Discussions from the decision-making process need to be translated into a case for support for an effort.  Evaluation findings gathered earlier will help you complete Activity F in the Appendix on page 95 and outline  why your coalition has decided to de-prioritize an effort, or asked other groups to continue it. When deciding  who may provide continuation funding for an effort, discuss who benefits from coalition success and how to  get them to help continue the effort. Involve these partners and collect data that demonstrate results.", "1729": "Creative Ways to Secure Funding Here are a few examples to consider when looking for longer-term funding sources.    Consider whether or not your current fiscal agent is able to manage funds from a variety of sources.   Request that coalition members add collaborative support costs into their funding proposals.    Use fees to continue community improvements (DeJong & Davidson, 2000). For example, fees charged to  rent local park facilities can fund continuing after-school recreation activities.    Leverage existing funding sources with other local efforts. For example, ask school districts or city and  county governments to financially support efforts that fall within their own programs. Also, consider  partnering with the local parks and recreation department to monitor trail usage on a quarterly basis by  sharing positions and resources.   Before approaching local funders, plan how to support them to create a win-win situation.", "1730": "Become a Nonprofit Organization?  A new coalition often does not have its own legal nonprofit status; a partner agency may act as the legal en- tity/fiscal agent. Before deciding to become a 501(c)(3) organization, consider potential benefits and conse- quences:  Potential Benefits   Coalition becomes more independentno longer under control of lead agency.    Coalition can decide which resources to seek and apply for funds directly.  Potential Consequences   Coalition may compete for funding with its own member agencies.    Time/money spent forming and managing a coalition may detract from its strategies (University of  Kansas Work Group, 2010b). Many of these issues can be addressed with the proper planning and bylaws. However, it will be important to  ensure that critical partners support this strategy.", "1731": "STEP 8DEVELOP A SUSTAINABILITY PLAN  This step pulls together the information gathered in the first seven steps. As previously mentioned, a sustain- ability plan describes a process for:   Obtaining input and buy-in from coalition members and key external decision-makers.   Defining critical long- and short-term policy strategies.   Considering the type of organizational structure will best help the coalition to effectively reach its part- nership, policy, and resource goals.   Acquiring resourceshuman, financial, and in-kindnecessary for implementing these strategies.   Documenting and organizing the information that has been collectedevaluation findings, lists of  strategies and activities, criteria grids, effort justification sheets, budgets, and more. How to Write the Sustainability Plan While the planning team is responsible for developing the contents of the plan (only one or two members will  actually author it), it needs buy-in from the full coalition. Therefore, all coalition members should be updated  on the plan as it is being developed. Consider the plan a living document, one with sustainability strategies  that can be revised as situations and funding streams change. Its a good idea to make the plan as concise as possible and include an appendix with items documenting the  entire planning process. These can help maintain institutional memory that will, in turn, help future planning  efforts replicate successes and avoid mistakes. Be prepared for requests for this backup documentation.  The planning team may find it helpful to develop planning documents for two different audiences. The first  document is the full sustainability plan and targets the coalition. It provides more specific operational strate- gies for achieving sustainability goals. The second document is a brief executive summary, or overview, to  share with outside parties, such as key community stakeholders and decision makers. Generally speaking,  this document provides a plain language snapshot of: (1) where youve been with respect to the sustainabil- ity-planning process, where you want to go, and how the coalition and community can help; and (2) what  you need from potential funders and collaborators in order to achieve your sustainability goals (University  of Kansas Work Group for Community Health and Development, 2010b). For an example of a brief executive  summary to share with partners, see Example 3 in the Appendix on page 99.", "1732": "Action Plans For each organizational or policy strategy, list the steps that need to be taken, due dates, and those respon- sible for implementation. Steps may include talking with policy makers, writing a grant proposal, transferring a  project to another organization, or reorganizing the structure of your coalition. Verify that timelines are realistic  and will not leave a gap between the end of the current funding stream and the start of new one. Ensure that  someone is responsible for tracking the progress of action plans and reporting back to the coalition.", "1733": "An outside facilitator can encourage multiple individuals to take on tasks, instead of those tasks falling on the  usual staff members. If many individuals are involved, they should check with one another regularly to moni- tor implementation progress. As with planning, tasks  should be accomplished on schedule. Consistent failure  to follow through may indicate lack of commitment or  an inability to continue the effort at hand.  While it helps to follow a plan, try to stay flexible. For ex- ample, you might plan to seek grant funding to continue  an initiative but then discover that another community  group is already funded to do the same work. You can  consider partnering to leverage your similar efforts.", "1734": "Use media, marketing, and networking to tell people which resources the coalition needs for sustaining com- munity health improvements. Review your connections maps (Step 3) to determine whether any important  connections were missed. If possible, hire temporary staff, consultants, and grant writers to help with commu- nication and resource efforts. ", "1735": "Keeping People Involved. One concern of groups trying to sustain community change is keeping partici- pants (e.g., staff, volunteers, members) engaged, since they often focus their time and energy on more than  one activity/organization. Be sure to:    Continuously recruit new members/staff and develop new  leaders to provide transition.    Meet with participants to discuss whether their needs are  being met. Are they developing desired skills? Does the ef- fort benefit their organization?    Provide periodic training through workshops, conference  calls, and webinars. If individuals need to build certain skills,  refer them to these training opportunities. For more, see  Module 4, Building  Coalition Members Skills, on page 76 of Sustainability Approaches Modules.    Implement communication strategies to keep members motivated and informed of the  plans progress.", "1736": "STEP 10EVALUATE OUTCOMES AND REVISE AS NEEDED  Now youve reached the last step in sustainability planning, but this should not be the first time you think  about evaluation. The evaluation experience is likely to be more positive and its results more useful if you  build evaluation in from the start and make it an on-going activity. This includes planning a summary evalua- tion before an intervention begins, which helps to clarify program goals and reasonable outcomes. At this stage, evaluation will help you improve your PSE efforts and implementation. It is important to peri- odically assess and adapt your organizational structure and activities for achieving your policy objectives to  ensure they are as effective as possible. Evaluation can help you identify areas for improvement and ultimately  help you realize your goals more efficiently (Hornik, 2002; Noar, 2006). It will also allow you to demonstrate  coalition success or progress. Does your coalitions current infrastructure and planning processes enable it to  effectively and efficiently achieve its goals? The information you collect allows you to better communicate  your coalitions impact to others, which is critical for public relations, staff morale, and attracting and retaining  support from current and potential funders (Hornik & Yanovitzky, 2003).

Policies can serve the concept of sustainability by providing long-term goals around which community  members can rally. A coalition should not only promote policies but also ensure that theyve been imple- mented as expected and are having the intended effect. Sustainability is, in large part, about developing momentum to maintain community-wide changes that  improve public health. Policy strategies are the most effective way to ensure long-term momentum. While individual approaches to behavior change are important for health promotion efforts, these changes  need to be prompted and supported by changes in environments, social norms, and networks that support  positive health decisions (Green, Richard, & Potvin, 1996; Stokols, 1996). Whether implemented in schools,  the community, or within community organizations, policy strategies can result in change on multiple lev- els, significantly impacting social and cultural norms and values (Swinburn, 2008; Stunkard & Pennick, 1979).  To achieve sustainability, a policy strategy needs to impact everyone in its priority population (Brownson,  2009). Policy strategies are a population-wide approach and can impact far more people than individual  strategies. Policies can also be replicated in multiple community settings and on many levels.  In addition, policy strategies are more economically sustainable long-term than other approaches (Swinburn,  2008). Once a policy has been implemented, few, if any, resources are usually needed to sustain resulting  community improvements. In fact, policy strategies can yield continuous improvements even if the institu- tions or coalitions that helped enact them are not themselves sustained (Holder & Moore, 2000, p. 75). For  these reasons, a policy approach is the best way to work toward sustainable change in the community.", "1743": "Why are coalitions and partnerships important for sustainability? The term coalition is used to describe a diverse group of individuals and organizations working together  to achieve specific goals. Internal partners are coalition members who help plan and participate in efforts to  accomplish those goals. External coalition partners (e.g., local decision-makers, funders, and media contacts)  can provide assets or champion coalition causes.  Strong coalitions and partnerships help support sustainability by providing a platform and process that  promote buy-in and support from participating community organizations and leaders. This heightened  level of support enhances the reputation of the coalition and the Healthy Communities Movement at large,  increasing the likelihood of new funding opportunities. Coalitions and partnerships can, among other things:   Serve as effective vehicles for exchanging knowledge and ideas.   Limit duplication of strategies and services.   Demonstrate and develop community support for issues.   Maximize the talents and resources of individuals and groups through collective action.   Improve trust, communication, and collaboration among community agencies and sectors.   Change community norms and standards concerning health-risk behaviors.   Promote policies to create sustainable change in systems and environments.", "1744": "Why is a home for Healthy Communities work important for sustainability? To ensure long-term success, a collaborative Healthy Communities initiative needs to adjust to potential  changese.g., in funding, local opportunities or alliances, public health needs, and community and coali- tion leadership priorities. A critical step in meeting this challenge is to consider where and how to organize  a base of operationsalso known as a community homeso that the initiative can flourish during and  after transformation (this includes thinking about the role of the fiscal agent). This community home should  be able to: serve as an objective broker of public health resources; solicit and administer a variety of funding  sources; appeal to a variety of community-based organizations; establish an internal infrastructure; and shift  priorities to accommodate changes in goals and community needs. As long as these criteria are met, a community home could be located in a government branch, a communi- ty health 501(c)3 organization, or an existing not-for-profit or for-profit venture (e.g., hospital or foundation).  Or it may be best to develop a new 501(c)3. Each option has its strengths and weaknesses. Also, what works  in one community may not work in another.  Once established, a community home could serve many important roles, including:    Leader and advocate   Overseer of knowledge transfer and translation   Convener/broker of relationships   Developer of standards   Evaluator of evidence-based practice/practice-based evidence   Monitor   Grantor", "1745": "Why are building coalition members skills important for sustainability? Coalition members want to learn new skills, develop their capabilities, and grow their knowledge and  careers. Helping them do so not only benefits the coalition as a whole, it also helps motivate members to  sustain their participation. Coalition training and skill buildingreferred to collectively here as trainingare geared toward admin- istrative, process, or public-health content. Administrative training topics can include fund-raising, proj- ect planning, budgeting, and structuring coalitions for success. Process training can include such items  as team building, leadership training, communication, and project planning. Public health content can  include current strategies to promote specific efforts around chronic disease risk factors (e.g., tobacco use,  prevention, and control), physical activity and nutrition, understanding health equity, and elements of the  built environment. Coalition members can learn skills from self-help methods (e.g., e-learning) or through  face-to-face workshops that can help with strategic or program planning and process training.  Coalitions can use a variety of assessment processes to determine the best type of training, including sur- veys, coalition-wide discussions, consultation with coalition coordinators or technical assistance (TA) staff,  and a review of the literature on best practices.  The last two options are particularly important, because they provide an outside, objective perspective. TA  staff members often come from funding organizations. They may have had high-level training and be in a  position to offer detached insight into coalition training needs. A literature review is important because it  can highlight ongoing research on how public health coalitions can function more effectively and accom- plish specific policy goals.", "1746": "Why are communication strategies important for sustainability?  By using various media to convey policy messages, coalitions are able to develop public/decision-maker  awareness and support around policy strategies, in addition to keeping them informed about the overall  Healthy Communities effort. Specifically, media efforts can help by:   Promoting decision-maker buy-in of coalition vision, mission, and plans.   Conveying the sense that coalition funds and other resources are being used wisely.   Increasing chances that new funding or other resource-development opportunities will present  themselves.   Setting the stage for collaboration or coordination between organizations. To get your message and call to action across clearly, make sure they are precise and easily understood.  The ways coalitions can keep community and decision-makers up-to-date include:   Newsletters (electronic) distributed through Web site or e-mail   Social media (e.g., Facebook or Twitter)   Regular columns in weeklies, newspapers, or trade publications   Periodic sustainability reports or annual action plans (print or electronic)   Annual reports highlighting current plans and progress as well as future strategies   Personal e-mails from coalition members to contacts   Talk shows appearances (e.g., radio/TV/podcasts)   Presentations at civic organization gatherings (e.g., Parent Teacher Organizations, Elks, Chamber  of Commerce, school superintendents, local trainings, or conferences) In addition to communicating policy messages, it is important for coalitions to consider:   Internal communication: Communication directed at managing the work of a coalition or  planning group.   Community-wide communication: Communication directed at keeping community members,  leaders, and key decision-makers up-to-date on the overall Healthy Communities effort.", "1747": "Why are social marketing strategies important for sustainability?  Social marketing provides an action framework for generating discussion and promoting information, at- titudes, and values that are conducive to long-term behavioral changes in certain populations. Influencing  behavior in individuals can contribute to policy changes within a community-at-large. When beginning  your coalitions social marketing plan, remember to keep the audiences perspective in mind and consider all  potential barriers to behavior change.  For your coalitions social marketing efforts to be successful, you need to know what can motivate a cer- tain population to adopt a desired behavior. When making the choice to change, a person has to make an  exchange, or give one thing up in return for something else. This exchange can be concrete (money) or less  tangible (e.g., improvement in health, social acceptance, or safety). It is important to offer something very  appealing in return for the desired behavior. To plan and implement an integrated social marketing strategy,  it is imperative to remember the 4 Ps of Marketing: product, price, place, and promotion.", "1748": "In response, EPA is issuing Planning for Sustainability: A Handbook for Water and Wastewater Utilities. The  Handbook describes a number of steps utilities can undertake to enhance their existing planning processes to  ensure that water infrastructure investments are cost-effective over their life-cycle, resource efficient, and support  other relevant community goals. Developed after extensive consultation and input from utilities, states, and other  stakeholders, the Handbook is organized around a series of Core Elements, including:  Setting utility sustainability goals and objectives that also support relevant community goals;  Analyzing a range of alternatives, including green infrastructure and other innovative approaches, based  on full life-cycle costs; and  Implementing a financial strategy, including adequate rate structures, to ensure the alternatives selected  are sufficiently funded, operated, maintained, and replaced over time.", "1749": "EPA believes that utilities which incorporate sustainability considerations into planning consistent with the steps in  this Handbook will realize many benefits because they will be able to better:  Optimize environmental, economic, and social benefits by setting goals and selecting projects through a  transparent and inclusive process with the community;  Consistently assess a range of alternatives that address utility and community goals; and  Enhance the long-term technical, financial, and managerial capacity of the utility. Protecting our communities and our precious water resources by sustaining our Nations water infrastructure is a  critical and ongoing challenge. This Handbook is designed to help address this challenge", "1750": "This handbook reflects a system-wide approach to planning that can drive a strategic shift from a project-by-project focus to one of utilities as systems. It can drive greater consideration of a utilitys role  within the community or watershed and open up opportunities to achieve water quantity and quality  objectives. Many water infrastructure decisions share interdependencies with housing, transportation,  and other infrastructure, requiring collaboration or pursuit of coordinated strategies to optimize these  investments. A system-wide approach involves utilities looking beyond the fence line to include  community institutions, and the implementation of projects outside the utilitys direct span of control.  There is also an opportunity to discuss collaborative partnerships with other municipal departments and  with neighboring utilities to share information and services, or to plan on a regional basis.", "1751": "A number of utilities are also facing challenging and sometimes competing infrastructure priorities  driven by regulatory requirements. This handbook, supplemented by other more specific guidance, can  help utilities consider a range of potential solutions that enable them to efficiently address their most  pressing public health and welfare issues. Utilities that effectively incorporate sustainability  considerations into planning can expect to achieve a number of benefits, including:  Minimizing costs by optimizing investment  choices, operating water and wastewater  systems more efficiently, and pursuing cost- effective investment and management  strategies, such as collaboration and  partnering with neighboring systems to  leverage resources and improve efficiency.   Maximizing results of investments to  ensure a continuing source of water,  treatment, and discharge capacity, as well as  financing capability.  Improving the ability to analyze a range of  alternatives, including (as appropriate) both  traditional and non-traditional infrastructure  alternatives, such as green infrastructure and/or decentralized systems, and selecting the  option or mix of options that best meet the needs of the utility and the community it serves.  Engendering greater support for the utility by recognizing community values and sustainability  priorities.  Ensuring that financial and revenue strategies are adequate to finance, operate, maintain, and  replace essential infrastructure throughout its operational life, while appropriately considering  the needs of disadvantaged households.", "1752": "This handbook focuses on helping utilities to incorporate sustainability considerations into their existing  planning processes effectively. It will assist them in selecting projects that ensure protection of public  health and water quality, support other relevant community goals, reflect full lifecycle costs, are based  on a robust analysis of alternatives (including conservation or green approaches), and are  implemented through an ongoing self-supporting financial strategy. If utilities are fully undertaking the  actions described in this handbook, they will make decisions that are the most appropriate for the utility  and the community and optimize economic, environmental, and social sustainability.", "1753": "Purpose and Intended Use of this Handbook  This handbook is intended to provide information about how to enhance current planning processes by  building in sustainability considerations. It is designed to be useful for various types and scales of  planning efforts, such as:  Long-range integrated water resource planning  Strategic planning  Capital planning   System-wide planning to meet regulatory requirements (e.g., combined sewer overflow  upgrades and new stormwater permitting requirements)  Specific infrastructure project planning (e.g., for repair, rehabilitation, or replacement of specific  infrastructure) A plans scope and time period will determine the scale of projects considered. For example,  comprehensive, long-range planning will typically focus on large-scale infrastructure, watershed, and/or  aquifer management decisions, while more routine, smaller scale project planning may focus on  narrower investments in new or existing infrastructure components or operational changes. In practice, the planning elements described in this handbook can enhance several planning processes at  a utility. For example, a utility can establish goals and objectives reflecting sustainability considerations  in a strategic planning process with a 10- to 15-year time horizon, then use them to guide 5-Year Capital  Plan decisions. Where applicable, utilities are also encouraged to engage with other municipal departments during the  planning process. For example, there may not be enough sludge generated by the utility alone to justify  the purchase and operation of a digester, but in combination with other organics collected by the solid  waste department, there may be enough energy generated to make the purchase.  This handbook is intended to be used by utilities of various sizes and levels of capability regardless of  their use of SRF or other federal water infrastructure funding. EPA recognizes that some elements of  the handbook may pose challenges for utilities delivering water and wastewater services at a smaller  scale, those that may have limited resources or capacity, or those that have not adopted a formal  planning process. The handbook describes steps these utilities can undertake to enhance their planning.  It also includes examples and resources specifically for utilities implementing activities at a smaller scale. Finally, EPA recognizes that some period of testing and refinement of this handbook will be necessary to  improve the document over time.", "1754": "Approach  Utility planning processes typically involve a series of consistent and predictable activities that  encompass identifying goals, setting objectives, assessing alternatives, and developing a financial Planning for Sustainability Page 5 strategy. In many cases, this process is complemented by ongoing asset management programs and  stakeholder involvement and communication. Based on this typical planning process, this handbook identifies four core elements where consistent and predictable practices can help utilities effectively  build sustainability considerations into their planning processes. The elements will help utilities set  sustainability goals and associated measurable objectives, consider a range of infrastructure  alternatives (including various watershed, conservation, or green alternatives), and implement a  financial strategy to ensure that the infrastructure alternatives selected are adequately financed,  maintained, and replaced over time. The elements (along with any related measurable results) can also  be revisited on an ongoing basis to ensure continuing implementation and improvement.  These core elements are: 1. Goal-Setting: Establish sustainability goals that reflect utility and community priorities. 2. Objectives and Strategies: Establish explicit, measurable objectives for each sustainability goal and  identify strategies for meeting the objectives.  3. Alternatives Analysis: Based on sustainability goals and objectives, set explicit and consistent  evaluation criteria to analyze a range of infrastructure alternatives. 4. Financial Strategy: Implement a financial strategy including adequate revenues so that new  infrastructure and operational investmentsas well as the overall systemare sufficiently funded,  operated, maintained, and replaced over time on a full lifecycle cost basis, with appropriate  considerations for disadvantaged households. These elements are intended to build on each  other as utilities go through a specific planning  process or they may be inter-related parts of  separate planning processes. Some utilities, however, may be adequately implementing  one or more of the elements and therefore  choose to focus greater attention on other  elements as a means of enhancing their  planning. For each element, this handbook describes  specific steps to enhance utilities planning  processes to aid effective and balanced  consideration of sustainability in the selection  of infrastructure projects. The steps for each  element, along with brief case examples and call-out boxes, also describe suggested practices from  utilities that have incorporated sustainability considerations into their planning. Each element also  includes diagnostic questions for gauging how thoroughly each element is addressed.", "1755": "Asset Management An ongoing asset management program that  includes detailed information on what assets a  utility has, how long they will last, and how much it  will cost to replace them, is essential to effective  utility management. An infrastructure inventory;  condition assessment; risk-based schedule for  maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and  replacement of infrastructure; and financial plan  are specific parts of a utilitys asset management  strategy. Asset management supports  sustainability planning in many ways, including:  Providing infrastructure capacity and  condition information;   Generating options for the repair,  rehabilitation, and replacement of existing  assets; and  Providing information on full lifecycle costs  of existing assets.", "1756": "Beyond implementing asset management, utilities  are also encouraged to perform an assessment of  their operations using the Effective Utility  Management Primer developed by EPA and six  national water sector associations.3 The Primer  helps utilities to assess their operations based on a  series of Attributes of Effectively Managed Utilities and to identify specific actions they can take to  improve their performance (see call-out box).", "1757": "Effective Utility  Management Primer developed by EPA and six  national water sector associations.3 ", "1758": "Community Engagement  Ongoing community engagementincluding in-person involvement and outreach and communications  with communitiesis important for establishing and maintaining community understanding of the value  of utility services and the resources needed to deliver them. Ideally, utilities undertake long-term  planning in the context of an ongoing relationship and active engagement with their communities and  customers. In the specific planning context, community input about sustainability goals and values can  inform utility service levels, reliability standards, revenue strategy, and other considerations.  Communication and transparency throughout the  planning process can lead to greater support for  utility decisions by increasing public understanding  of the value of water infrastructure and utility  services. Building customer and community  appreciation of infrastructure investment value is  likely to require proactive, ongoing stakeholder  education and involvement. For example, changes  to utility rates and fees typically require the approval  of a governing body (e.g., utility board, municipal or  county council) and can be difficult in the absence of  reasonable customer support. Utilities that have  established and clearly communicated a case for  infrastructure investment value and that have a  reputation for effective management and transparency are more likely to garner support for needed  rate and fee increases.", "1759": "Ongoing community engagement can support the planning process by:  Providing necessary input early in the process;  Providing understanding of community goals and values (e.g., for green space or economic  redevelopment) to guide the utilities strategic direction and the identification and weighting  alternatives assessment criteria;  Generating specific ideas about strategies to meet goals, which may be also considered as part  of the alternatives analysis where specific projects are selected; and  Building a base of community understanding and support for selecting service levels,  establishing reliability standards, and meeting revenue needs through rate changes or other  mechanisms.", "1760": "Recording and tracking issues raised by community members should be carefully undertaken and can  help utilities be transparent and responsive. Appendix A includes several guides, tools, and case studies  with other strategies for engaging with the community.", "1761": "Element Description  Utilities should consider and set sustainability goals to provide a foundation for incorporating  sustainability considerations throughout the planning process. These goals should reflect internal  assessment of sustainability priorities as well as community sustainability priorities identified through  information gathering and consultation with local institutions and stakeholders. Utilities are also  encouraged to engage other municipal departments, as appropriate. For example, there may not be  enough biosolids generated by the utility to cost-effectively operate a digester, but in combination with  organics collected by the solid waste department, there may be enough energy generated to justify a  major equipment purchase.  Ideally, utility consultation with communities  and customers about sustainability goals occurs as part of ongoing engagement about  services, key decisions, and revenue needs.  Information gathering about community  sustainability priorities, however, can take  many forms, from review of existing  community plans or other documents to  direct consultation with community  representatives (e.g., planning agencies,  elected officials, and stakeholder groups).  Sustainability goals are critical for guiding  utilities as they move through the other three  elements to set measurable objectives and  strategies, analyze alternatives, and develop a  financial strategy to support chosen  investments.", "1762": "Current Planning Process  In their existing planning processes, utilities often set goals based on community planning information  that defines the amount, type, and location of future demand for the utilities services. Relevant  information often includes population growth projections, the location and nature of planned  development, and zoning changes. This information typically flows one-way from community  development plans, master plans, and growth management plans to the water utility. Water sector  utilities are then in a position to describe how they will be able to help address other community priorities in the future. However, utilities typically have a limited role in helping communities understand the expected impacts of planned growth, such as infrastructure needs and associated costs.  For example, projections of the lifecycle infrastructure costs of accommodating planned growth can  allow for better informed community decisions.", "1763": "Building Sustainability Considerations into Goal Setting  For purposes of this handbook, setting sustainability goals at the outset of the planning process should  involve information gathering and, where feasible, consultation with community members or other planning institutions about community sustainability priorities. This activity can take several forms  depending on the utilitys capabilities, needs, and relationship to the community. Figure 2 illustrates a  continuum of different types of up-front information gathering and/or consultation between a utility  and the community.", "1764": "The center of the continuum represents more active engagement between the utility and the  community to discuss community sustainability priorities. This engagement can be through meetings  Utility gathers  information from  existing documents  about community  sustainability  priorities Utility actively engages  with community about  community sustainability  priorities Utility partners with  community to jointly  formulate  sustainability priorities  Sustainability GoalsPlanning for Sustainability Page 14 with planning officials, involvement in ongoing community forums about desired growth and  development, or convening stakeholders representing community organizations to better understand  their priorities.  The right hand side of the continuum represents active partnership between the utility and the  community to jointly formulate sustainability goals that both the utility and the community can actively  pursue. Partnerships, either formal or informal, allow the utility and community not just to understand  each others priorities but also to enable each others activities. For example, the water utility that  serves Hidden Valley Lake, California worked over time to enhance drinking water source protection. It  ultimately influenced the nature and location of development through a role in land use permitting  under the direction of the local planning department (see call out box later in this section). Any of the approaches along this continuum can be used depending on the utilitys capacity and  resources, as well as local conditions. Regardless of the approach taken, the following steps can help  utilities effectively engage in consultation at the beginning of the planning process and set sustainability  goals", "1765": "The left side of the continuum represents the utility gathering information from existing community  planning documents or key individuals (such as the town manager or town clerk) about sustainability  priorities related to areas such as transportation, recreation, and housing. Although this approach may  be appropriate for some utilities and communities (particularly in cases where utility capacity or  resources are constrained), most utilities will find significant value added from more active community  consultation.", "1766": "Step 1. Identify sustainability priorities and potential opportunities for the utility Utilities first consider their own sustainability priorities by internally assessing infrastructure and  operations that may provide opportunities for increased sustainability and improved performance. For  example, utilities may want to assess operations using the Effective Utility Management Primer  described in the Introduction to this handbook. Similarly, many aspects of a utilitys asset management  plan can provide useful information for identifying sustainability opportunities. A vulnerability  assessment can pinpoint opportunities for improved system resilience. It can also identify gaps in  technical, managerial, and financial capacity that, when address, can help utilities achieve sustainability  goals. For many utilities, sustainability priorities may focus almost exclusively on strategies for meeting  regulatory requirements or approaches for sustaining existing infrastructure and operations as opposed  to new projects.  Although Step 1 is internally focused, it can be informed by ongoing customer and community  relationships and their expectations about the role and operation of the utility. It can also be informed  by the range of incentives utilities have to become more sustainable, including cost savings, financial  benefits, and alignment with the utilities traditional mission or sustainability policies.", "1767": "Step 2. Identify community  sustainability priorities As a second step, utilities should gather  information to understand broader  community sustainability priorities.  Utilities can utilize planning documents or  ongoing planning efforts to gather relevant  community sustainability priority information, such as transportation plans,  climate action plans, watershed plans, or  community vision documents. As part of considering these plans, utilities  should develop familiarity with the  community-wide priorities these plans  seek to address. Furthermore, utilities  should improve understanding of the institutions (and key contact personnel)  responsible for planning, and  opportunities for involvement in ongoing  planning processes (e.g., as part of  steering committees, or through direct  agency-to-agency dialogue).  ", "1768": "Step 3. Engage the community about  its sustainability priorities  In many cases, utilities will find value in  pursuing active engagement or  partnerships with the community. These  utilities will need to identify forums or  other opportunities for consultation with  community planning institutions or  stakeholders. (Some utilities with limited  resources or capacity may not be able to engage the community actively but can still gather available  information as described in Step 2). In some cases, effective engagement can also be accomplished  through discussions with key individuals, such as the town manager or clerk. Active community engagement seeks to identify sustainability priorities, describe how water  infrastructure decisions affect a communitys ability to achieve priorities, and provide an opportunity to  discuss how the utility and community can align sustainability efforts. These discussions should address  what communities are willing and able to afford if new infrastructure is needed or if other costs Approaches for Involving Stakeholders in Planning A variety of approaches for involving stakeholders in planning can  be used in various stages of the planning process:  Using existing boards or other governing bodies to  provide stakeholder perspectives or as a means for  collecting information about community priorities and  communicating about utility activities  Establishing and maintaining an informal network of  community opinion leaders periodically consulted on  community priorities or utility sustainability objectives  Ongoing communications through websites, press  releases, and other channels to keep the broad  community informed about the utility planning process  and decisions  Public meetings to inform the community about key  milestones in the planning process and solicit feedback  on key decisions  Focus groups, surveys, or related strategies for soliciting  information about community goals, priorities, values,  and ideas  A stakeholder steering committee to advise throughout  the process on key planning decisions, such as setting  long-range goals and establishing project selection  criteria and/or weighting schemes To select an approach, assess how much stakeholder input and  support is needed to make decisions consistent with both utility  and community priorities. Consider:  What are the potential rate implications, including for  disadvantaged households?  What is the potential for community disruption?   What is the overall cost and duration of the effort?  Do we need consensus for a timely and effective  implementation? The answers will help utilities determine what stakeholders to  involve, how often, over what period of time, and what outcome is  needed. This information will inform the time and other resources  for stakeholder engagement.Planning for Sustainability Page 16 necessitate increases of rates or fees. Such  discussions help set realistic expectations  about levels of service and community  costs, and inform the process for  evaluating alternatives (described in  Element 3). Consulting stakeholder groups can help  build support for utility goals and specific  infrastructure decisions. For example,  utilities considering watershed protection  goals may benefit from consultation with local land use agencies, private land  owners, developers, or local watershed  groups. Among other things, these  stakeholders may see utility vulnerabilities  not identified by internal personnel.  As part of the consultation process, utilities  may want to consult with neighboring  utilities to understand how peer  institutions are addressing sustainability.  This consultation can also create an  opportunity to explore potential  collaboration opportunities and partnering  relationships. Other important stakeholders include  economic development, transportation, or  other agencies that set local long-term  growth and development strategies. The forum and nature of discussions on these topics can vary  widely depending on institutional context. For example, a utility housed in a public works or other  department may have consultation with another department facilitated through the leadership of the  mayor, city manager, or city council and governed by city-wide policies. In contrast, an independent  enterprise utility seeking to consult with municipal or county planners may need to establish new  institutional relationships, such as a formal or informal steering committee made up of the senior  management from the relevant agencies.", "1769": "Consultation opportunities are as varied as the communities in which they take place, including the  following examples: Hidden Valley Lake, California: Encouraging the  Community to Engage with Water Utilities about  Planning For certain sustainability goalssuch as source water protection utilities will need to work with other community institutions that  guide local land use and economic development. Water utility  experience in Hidden Valley Lake, California illustrates how utilities  and communities need to work together on sustainability goalsin  this case by developing community planner appreciation for what  utilities have to say about sustainable growth and development. Hidden Valley Lake is a rural community of around 4,000 people in  northern California. The Hidden Valley Lake Community Service  District (CSD) provides drinking water to around 1,500 lots from  three high quality domestic water supply wells. In the early 1990s,  CSD sought a greater role in commenting on development permits  issued by the county planning department. CSD sought to avoid  development that might harm groundwater resources and  potentially lead to increased treatment costs.  The county planning department was initially reluctant to increase  CSDs role in its existing permitting process. By working with the  local County Board of Supervisors and other means, CSD  eventually obtained a role in commenting on permits on a project- by-project basis. CSD recognized, however, that commenting on  individual projects was insufficient to protect the areas water  resources over the long term. With continued support from the  County Board of Supervisors, CSD moved from commenting on  individual permits to playing a deeper role in county planning both on a working level and as a critical stakeholder in the  countys Master Plan development. Today, CSD maintains a  productive working relationship with county planners and has a  strong voice in how the community grows.Planning for Sustainability Page 17  Participating in direct discussions with  other planning institutions and community  bodies early in their planning processes.  Utilities can go directly to other local  planning institutions to discuss sustainability priorities. In some cases, community  institutions, such as county councils or city  managers, may need to support and encourage the consultation, and utilities  may need to build relationships with  planning agencies and encourage support  for collaboration over time.  Getting involved with existing community- wide planning efforts. Where communities  are already involved in community-wide  planning or visioning, utilities can play an  active and important role in helping to  define community goals and the actions  supporting them. For example, the city of  Portsmouth, New Hampshire undertook a master planning process (culminating in a plan in  2004) that involved many citizens and community institutions in discussions to define a future  vision for the city. The role of water infrastructure was an integral part of the plan, which called  out as a key priority water and sewer policies and infrastructure [that] make use of best  practices in environmental protection and provide incentives for conservation. The  development of the communitys Master Plan was influenced by utilities existing water and  wastewater plans. The Master Plan then drove subsequent infrastructure decisions by the local  utilities, including construction of a LEED-certified water treatment plant (see case study at the  end of this section for more information on the Portsmouth, New Hampshire case).  Aligning utility planning with existing community plans. If community plans already exist,  utilities can incorporate the plans goals into their own planning efforts. This may not involve  active utility participation in community planning itself, but rather a strategic decision to  incorporate community goals into the utilitys own planning efforts. For example, the City of  Portland, Oregon Water Bureau aligned with Portlands Climate Action Plan by setting specific  objectives in its Strategic Plan to reduce carbon emissions. It then identified (and monitored)  specific carbon reduction actions through the Water Bureaus Sustainability Action Plan. (See  more about the Portland case at the end of the next section.) Cross-sector Coordination for Sustainability at  the Federal Level: The HUD-DOT-EPA  Partnership on Sustainable Communities At the federal level, the Departments of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD) and Transportation (DOT),  along with EPA, have joined together through the  HUD-DOT-EPA Partnership on Sustainable  Communities to help improve access to affordable  housing, more transportation options, and lower  transportation costs while protecting the environment in  communities nationwide. Through a set of guiding  livability principles and a partnership agreement, this  partnership will coordinate federal housing,  transportation, and other infrastructure investments to  protect the environment, promote equitable  development, and help address the challenges of  climate change. One goal of the federal partnership is  to have this kind of cross-sector coordination occur at  all levels of government. More information about this  Partnership is available at  http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/partnership/.Planning for Sustainability Page 18 Convening a stakeholder process for water planning. Absent ongoing processes, utilities may need to  take the initiative to convene and consult directly with members of the community. For example, Quay  County, New Mexico convened a stakeholder steering committee representing the rural countys 10,000  residents to outline a vision and goals and to guide development of its 40-year water plan. Similarly, the  Envision Utah program, a community-wide conversation about the future of the state, outlined a  Community Design Workshop process providing communities with a water conservation plan development blueprint involving teams of citizens representing a cross-section of local interests.4", "1770": "Step 4. Identify and document sustainability goals Regardless of the up-front consultation approach, the utility should document and make available a  description of its process and identify the sustainability goals that emerged from the consultation.  These goals will guide development of the remaining elements, including decisions about infrastructure  investments and other potential utility operational changes. Documentation can also help communicate  sustainability goals to boards, other oversight bodies, and utility employees. As utilities develop goals, maintaining regular communication with stakeholders and relevant regulatory  agencies will help lay the foundation for (and engender support for) subsequent decisions about specific  strategies and investment alternatives. A transparent decision-making process will help utilities gain the  support of the community.", "1771": "Element Description  Utilities should develop one or more explicit and measurable objectives for sustainability goals selected  in Element 1. These objectives translate sustainability goals into the specific achievements the utility  will work toward. Utilities should also assess their current performance (or baseline) relative to each  sustainability objective and identify general strategies to meet them.  ", "1772": "Specific project and program alternatives based on the strategies identified at this stage of planning will  be specifically evaluated through alternatives analysis later in the planning process (Element 3). Strategy implementation should include measurement and evaluation to determine if further advances  and improvements can be made over time.", "1773": "Step 1. Identify sustainability objectives  Utilities should identify an objective or objectives for each sustainability goal. Any vulnerabilities in  technical, managerial, or financial capacity of the utility that would preclude achieving sustainability  goals should be targeted for specific objectives and strategies. Measuring performance relative to  vulnerabilities is critical to achieving a sustainable course of action.  In some cases, utilities may want to  express sustainability objectives in  terms of specific quantitative  targets. For example, a utility may  want to reduce energy  consumption by 10 percent or  increase water efficiency by 25  percent. In other cases, a utility may want to develop procedural  objectives, such as developing  policies that target infrastructure  investments to existing  communities. Utilities may also  want to establish a procedural  objective to create a level playing  field among optionsincluding  those that are more sustainable.  For example, a utility could set an  objective to evaluate non- traditional project alternatives  (e.g., decentralized wastewater  solutions, green infrastructure for  stormwater, etc.) along with  conventional grey infrastructure  or to evaluate partnership  opportunities in any analysis of  system expansion options.", "1774": "Step 2. Ensure that objectives are SMART The most effective objectives are SMART:  Specific: Utilities specify exactly what they want to achieve  Measurable: Utilities are able to measure whether they are meeting the objectives  Attainable: Utilities can realistically achieve the objective in the time period specified  Realistic: Utilities can achieve the objective with the capacity, funding, and other resources available  Time-based: Utilities set a timeframe for achieving the objective An example of a SMART objective, which was developed by the City of Portland Water Bureau, is: Reduce the bureaus overall electrical use by 5 percent (excluding variation due to weather and  groundwater operation) by July 2012, compared to a 2005-08 baseline. While these objectives clearly establish a target, other types of objectives can be similarly SMART. For  example, a utility could establish an objective to evaluate green infrastructure alternatives for any  proposed infrastructure investment of over $10 million and revisit the investment threshold in five  years. Utilities should strive to set objectives that are achievable and realistic. They may, however, be  operating in an environment where information on their baseline and realistic objectives is lacking. In  this case, utilities may want to set provisional objectives that can be refined later. As part of a continual  improvement process, these objectives may be refined and adapted over time as more information is  gathered and project alternatives are evaluated and selected. For example, a utility may identify current  energy consumption and the relative costs and benefits of energy efficiency alternatives before setting a  specific target. Utilities with low hanging fruit may set an ambitious objective, while utilities with few  remaining low-cost efficiency options may set a more conservative target.", "1775": "Step 3. Analyze baseline performance Utilities should conduct and document a baseline analysis for each sustainability objective. For some objectives, the analysis of baselines will be data-driven and quantitative. For example, a utility  with an objective to reduce energy use by 10 percent over five years could conduct an energy audit to  identify baseline energy use. The analysis can use publicly available tools, such as EPAs Portfolio  Manager for water utilities, and readily-accessible information such as utility bills (see Appendix A for  links to a variety of energy audit and analysis tools).  Examples of other useful baseline analysis information sources include:  Asset inventories and condition assessments to establish the degree of baseline deployment,  effectiveness, and cost; Planning for Sustainability Page 27  Population and land use projections to forecast future demand inside and outside of service  areas to understand needs and opportunities for infrastructure investments focused on existing  communities; and  Water service supply and demand data to establish a baseline for water efficiency and use (e.g.,  for an analysis of water conservation opportunities)", "1776": "Step 4. Identify key strategies Baseline analysis can help utilities identify  general strategies for achieving sustainability  objectives and for conducting in-depth  alternatives analysis (described later in this  handbook). In addition to considering  strategies that would involve new  infrastructure, utilities can consider, where  appropriate, collaboration and partnering  relationships as a way to meet objectives. In  many cases, it may be useful to undertake a  basic brainstorming approach. As utilities begin this step, they should keep in  mind basic tips about brainstorming:  Dont judge, challenge, evaluate, or  criticize suggested strategies;   Emphasize the quantity of ideas, not  quality; and  Put analysis and organization in the background.", "1777": "Step 5. Document objectives,  baselines, and strategies Once a utility has set objectives, it should  incorporate them into utility planning  documents along with information about  baselines. Utilities should document how progress towards objectives will be  measured and should be willing to adapt  their strategies over time. Some utilities  may choose to document objectives through  an Environmental Management System (see  call-out box about Camden County, at right).  EPA has developed a variety of tools to help  water and wastewater utilities adopt  environmental management systems.  These tools are listed in Appendix A.  Utilities should also document general  strategies (and related tools and resources)  that suggest project alternatives to be  considered in alternatives analysis (Element  3). For example, a utility evaluating the  feasibility of non-traditional strategies for  meeting future drinking water needs would  identify a range of strategies that include  source water protection, reduction of non- point sources of pollution, and potential  service interconnections with adjacent  utilities. The most promising strategies can  be further analyzed as part of alternatives  analysis.", "1778": "Element Description  Effectively integrating sustainability goals and objectives into an analysis of infrastructure alternatives is  a critical component of planning. It allows utilities and local officials to make infrastructure decisions  consistent with sustainability goals and objectives best suited for the utility and the community. Alternatives analysis can be conducted at many  scales, from an analysis of system-wide  infrastructure alternatives to specific engineering  decisions about the repair, rehabilitation, or  replacement of specific equipment. The steps  and examples described below focus on project- level alternatives analysis linked to utility goals  and objectives but can be translated to different  scales. For alternatives analysis to be effective, utilities  need to establish explicit and consistent project  selection criteria for each sustainability objective.  Identifying and applying sustainability criteria is  the critical juncture at which utilities choose the  specific economic, environmental, and social  benefits they will weigh in selecting among  alternatives. A replicable, consistent, and  transparent approach will ensure that each  alternative is considered on a level playing field.  When done well, this approach will enable utilities to choose a mix of projects that meets  customers service expectations, optimizes the  sustainability of utility infrastructure and  operations, and supports other community  sustainability priorities whenever feasible. The  selected alternatives will thus represent best  value projects for the utility and for the  community as a whole.", "1779": "Current Planning Process  Utilities commonly undertake alternatives analysis as part of planning. They then document selected or  recommended alternatives in planning documents. Alternatives often involve the repair, rehabilitation,  or replacement of aging infrastructure or investment in new infrastructure to meet demand growth or regulatory requirements, including those driven by enforcement actions. As typically practiced,  alternatives analysis considers criteria such as technical performance, cost, maintainability, and  reliability. These criteria screen for alternatives that deliver the highest reliable performance at the  lowest overall cost. Conventional alternatives analysis, however, rarely explicitly and consistently  incorporates broader economic, social, and environmental sustainability considerations.", "1780": "Building Sustainability Considerations into Alternatives Analysis  Incorporating sustainability considerations into alternatives analysis may involve the following  adjustments to current planning processes:  Using a broader set of assessment  criteria that explicitly link to the  utilitys specific sustainability goals,  objectives, and other community  priorities, where applicable;  Using a consistent and documented  methodology for evaluating and  comparing projects using the  criteria;  Including specific consideration of  natural or green systems; and  Potentially using other relevant  community input to inform the  assessment methodology (e.g., by  weighting criteria according to  community priorities). The following steps will help utilities incorporate sustainability considerations into alternatives analysis.", "1781": "tep 1. Identify alternatives Utilities should list and describe a broad range of project alternatives that, individually or in  combination, support the stated objectives. Many project alternatives will come from the general  Evaluating Green Infrastructure Alternatives  As part of alternatives analysis, utilities should assess what types  of non-traditional or green infrastructure alternatives may help  achieve objectives. Lack of familiarity or experience with these  alternatives, however, can create challenges. In particular,  utilities may face uncertain operations and maintenance costs for  green infrastructure alternatives. In response, utilities can phase in green infrastructure  investments and then consider further deployment based on  what they learn about effectiveness and cost. In alternatives  analysis, utilities may want to examine a range of deployment  optionsfrom pilot scale to maximum technically achievable and identify the right level of deployment given their needs and  the level of knowledge or uncertainty about green infrastructure.Planning for Sustainability Page 35 strategies identified in Element 2. For example, a facility may have identified source water protection as  a viable strategy for protecting groundwater to meet future demand. In the alternatives analysis, the  utility would evaluate options that specifically identify candidate source water areas, protection  strategies, time frames, and other specific characteristics.", "1782": "tep 2. Develop sustainability  criteria The criteria used to assess and select  projects in the alternatives analysis  should reflect a utilitys sustainability  objectives identified in Element 2.  Utilities will also likely include criteria  related to other utility objectives  (reliability, risk management, etc.).  Setting and applying project selection  criteria is the critical juncture at which  utilities choose the economic,  environmental, and social benefits they  will weigh in selecting among  alternatives and choosing the mix of  projects that optimizes the sustainability  of utility operations.  Community stakeholder views are also  important when evaluating alternatives.  Where feasible, utilities should consider  using community input to identify  project selection criteria and their  relative importance. For example,  Louisville and Jefferson County  Metropolitan Sewer District in Kentucky convened community stakeholders to  identify community values for analyzing and selecting among options for  reducing wet weather flows. The  community values, which included  public health enhancement and  economic vitality among others, were  used to calculate benefit scores for each  project alternative. These scores were  combined with cost information for a  ", "1783": "benefit-cost comparison across alternatives (see the Louisville case study at the end of this section).", "1784": "Step 3. Assess the benefits of each alternative  Each alternative should be analyzed on an individual basis using Step 2 criteria. Different types of  analysis may be appropriate for different plans or for utilities with different levels of capacity. Options  include:  A narrative, qualitative assessment of potential benefits and risks of each alternative (may be  most appropriate for utilities with limited resources or capacity). For example, to develop a capital improvement plan, Bloomington, Indianas water utility qualitatively evaluated several  alternatives according to criteria including redundancy, consequences of a failure, capital and  operations and maintenance costs, and flexibility for expansion.  A qualitative scoring of potential benefits and risks. For example, Louisville and Jefferson  County Metropolitan Sewer District used a -5 to +5 scale to rate alternatives impacts on  ecosystems; the community then calculated an overall score across the criteria. (See Louisville  case study at the end of this section. The Tualatin Valley Water District also used this approach,  as described in a call-out box in this section.)  A quantitative assessment, such as monetizing benefits and risks using economic valuation  techniques. For example, Seattle Public Utilities used economic valuation techniques to  quantify benefits and costs for infrastructure investment alternatives (see the call-out box in this  section).", "1785": "The evaluation of each alternative should be documented using a common template. To aid  comparison, utilities should use the same methodology for all alternatives. Consistent tools and  templates allow for efficient analysis and documentation of a potentially large number of projects.  A scorecard approach is one way to analyze a range of alternatives across several criteria. This  approach helps utilities organize both qualitative and quantitative information to make decisions.  Implementation can range from fairly simple to complex depending on the number of alternatives  assessed and criteria used. Once developed, it can be reused whenever necessary.", "1786": "Because the utility is utilizing several criteria, a weighting approach can be helpful to provide an overall  score. Utilities may choose to weight each criterion equally, or choose to weight certain criteria more  highly. To weight criteria the utility can distribute a total number of points among criteria. In this  example, the utility distributes ten points among the three criteria. Riparian area protection and odor  control are considered equally importantand more important than construction-related disruptions.  The utility then gives a weight of 4 points each to riparian area protection and odor control, and 2 points  to non-obtrusive construction techniques. (In some casesas in the Louisville example described at the  end of this sectionutilities base their weighting approach on community priorities, increasing the  likelihood of acceptance by the community.)", "1787": "ep 4: Assess the full lifecycle costs of each alternative Utilities should assess the full lifecycle costs  of each alternative to provide a full  accounting of the projects annualized cost  and revenue impacts. Lifecycle costs are  the net present value of all costs for a  project over its lifetime, including primary  project costs, secondary financing costs,  operations and maintenance and the cost of  rehabilitation, repair, and replacement.  Primary project costs include:   Construction;   Engineering and technical services (e.g., surveying and subsurface investigations);   Pilot studies;  Environmental review and permitting;   Bidding and contracts;   Administration and legal services;   Land and right-of-way acquisition;   Bond issuance;  Commissioning costs;  Construction management; and  Decommissioning. Indirect financing costs include the cost of  capital (i.e., interest), capital acquisition  costs (such as financial advisory fees, rating  agency fees, closing costs, etc.), and costs  related to creating any required reserve  funds and/or meeting debt coverage  covenants. Utilities should be aware that  grants or other financing incentives can  affect indirect costs and potentially influence  which alternatives appear to be most cost- effective. New project operating costs can include energy use, chemical use, operating staff, and the projects  share of general utility overhead expense. Basic maintenance costs will likely include the personnel,  equipment, and materials needed to keep the project infrastructure operating properly and reliably.  Alternatives that require more ongoing monitoring and maintenance will generally have higher lifecycle  The Cost of the No Action Alternative When assessing whether to make new investments, utilities  should account for the costs of the no action alternativeor  maintaining the status quo. These costs may be hidden and  substantial. They include:  The cost of inefficient operations and excess maintenance for older underperforming capital;  The cost of expensive reactive emergency repairs to  aging infrastructure (vs. predictive and preventive  maintenance for newer infrastructure); and  Fines or other penalties (e.g., for not meeting regulatory  requirements). The longer utilities wait to replace underperforming capital, the  more these costs are likely to increase. When utilities examine all  costs of inaction, they may find that new investments can save  money and improve sustainability over the long term. Taking the Long View in Alternatives Analysis When analyzing alternatives, utilities should look to the future to  maximize long-term benefits and reduce long-term costs. For  example, when considering replacing underground pipes in the  existing service area that are likely to experience increasing  demand from urban infill, a utility should also consider installing  extra capacity for the future. While this may involve additional  up-front expenses, it may reduce costs over the long term by  avoiding the need to re-excavate the lines.Planning for Sustainability Page 42 operations and maintenance costs. Effective asset management programs can help utilities assess these  costs, as well as costs for rehabilitation, repair, and replacement. Key considerations in assessing lifecycle costs are the time period analyzed and the discount rate. A long  period analyzed will tend to favor longer-lived infrastructure not requiring replacement during the time  period. Take as an example a utility considering two alternatives for managing stormwater: 1) an  underground storage basin with a 110-year life, and 2) high-capacity remote treatment technology with  a 40-year life. With a 100-year view, the utility might favor the storage basin because the remote  treatment technology would need to be replaced twice over the 100-year period. If that same utility  only looked out 35 years, the analysis might turn economically favorable for the remote treatment  technology", "1788": "tep 5. Compare and select alternatives Utilities should employ a consistent approach for comparing projects and ranking alternatives in terms  of benefits and costs. The approach should allow for the comparison of a wide range of alternatives. Again, different types of analysis may be appropriate for different types of plans or utilities. Options  include: San Antonio Water System: Saving Money and Protecting Habitat by Conserving Water The San Antonio Water System (SAWS) in South Central Texas serves 1.3 million people. Its water comes primarily from  the Edwards Aquifer, a fractured limestone formation spanning 8,000 square miles. With San Antonios population growing 2 percent per year, a finite water supply (which also sustains habitat for 14 threatened and endangered species), and limits on  pumping during drought conditions, the system faced a need to either buy additional water rights from an adjacent aquifer or  conserve.  After detailed analysis, San Antonio concluded that investments in conservation technology and programs to achieve water  use reductions would allow the system to serve its growing population and would cost less than purchasing and delivering  additional water. Specifically, investing $4.8 million per year in conservation allowed the city to reap $7.4 million in avoided  water purchase and infrastructure costs (a cost-benefit ratio of 1: 1.5).  For residences, conservation strategies included efficient toilets, rebates, hot water on demand, garden irrigation  evaluations, and education. Commercial sector strategies included whole facility retrofits, industry certification for water use,  water audits, and rewards. San Antonio also instituted water use regulations governing water waste, irrigation system  design and timing, drought restrictions, and on-site water reclamation. With these conservation strategies, San Antonio residents reduced their per-capita water usage 49 percent between 1982  and 2007, while the citys water customer base increased 30 percent. With these results, San Antonio achieved its water  use reduction goal for 2008 seven years early. The system has also kept pumping rates stable in the Edwards Aquifer and  maintained water prices that are significantly less than the national average (i.e., $0.12/100 gallons vs. a national average of  $0.28/100 gallons).

A 2002 EPA study estimated that water utilities face a 20-year operations and maintenance funding gap  of $148 billion for clean water utilities and $161 billion for drinking water utilities.14 A General  Accounting Office report from the same year concluded that over 25 percent of drinking water utilities  and over 40 percent of wastewater utilities did not collect enough in user fees and other local sources of  revenue to cover their full cost of service (including operations and maintenance, debt service,  depreciation, and taxes).15 Building Sustainability Considerations into Financial Strategies  The remainder of this section describes financial strategies to help utilities  close or avoid such funding gaps", "1795": "For the purposes of this handbook, building a sustainable project financing strategy may involve altering  or emphasizing various aspects of the traditional project financing strategy, as follows:  Ensuring a complete accounting of all project- related capital, operations, maintenance, and  replacement costs on a full lifecycle cost basis  (making sure to account for asset depreciation  and full costing of predictive and preventive  maintenance);  Undertaking a fair and complete comparison of  capital financing alternatives, covering interest,  acquisition, and implementation costs; and  Reviewing and adjusting, as needed, the timing,  amount, and structure of rates, fees, charges,  and other revenue sources consistent with projections for new project related revenue  requirements.", "1796": "tep 1: Account fully for all project capital costs There are two types of project capital costs. Primary project capital costs should have been built into  costs used for alternatives analysis.

Secondary capital costs are linked to the  capital financing method. They include the  cost of capital (interest rate), capital  acquisition costs (such as financial advisory  fees, rating agency fees, closing costs, etc.),  and costs related to creating any required  reserve funds or meeting debt coverage  covenants. Even grants have some costs,  such as grant application and administration  costs. The example on this page shows a cost  analysis from the Quay County, New Mexico  Forty Year Water Plan. The analysis is for a  conventional treatment and pumping system  that includes an intake structure, pumping  station, storage tanks, treatment plant,  pipelines, and other pieces of component  infrastructure. Primary costs include  construction, design services, funding  activities, public education, and other  itemsalong with 5-year projected costs for  operations and maintenance and  replacement. In addition, the cost estimate  includes the secondary capital cost of debt  service on financed share for the financed  component of the project. It is critical that the utility account fully for all capital financing costsusing up-to-date information on  interest rates and other factorsand build them into future revenue requirements analysis. Calculating  new projects overall impact on average annual capital financing costs and the maximum annual future  debt service payment will help utilities understand the effects of new projects on the utilitys cost  structure.", "1797": "Step 2: Account fully for operations and  maintenance costs The selected project alternatives will likely  change overall operations and maintenance  costs for the utility (either up or down).  Although these costs should have been fully  profiled during alternatives analysis, it is  important to thoroughly review the estimates  at this point in the process. This will ensure  revenue requirement estimates are fully  reflective of any changes in O&M costs  resulting from the new project(s). From a project financial sustainability point of  view, asset depreciation is an additional  operating cost area to consider. Establishing a  project depreciation expense, an area of  potential weakness in many revenue adequacy determinations, is critical to estimating revenue  requirements sufficient to replace aging infrastructure. Revenue requirements reflecting depreciation  costs can provide the means to establish and fund repair and replacement accounts. Underfunding predictive and preventive maintenance (i.e., failing to fully estimate costs as part of the  revenue requirements determination) is a key vulnerability of revenue adequacy determinations.  Ongoing condition assessment costs of any new infrastructure also need to be accounted for, consistent  with the utilitys asset management program requirements. Overall, maintenance costs will be unique  to the particular assets involved, but should be driven by the utilitys asset management program, which  will set the type and frequency of desired maintenance. Because underfunding predictive and  preventive maintenance is a common problem, thorough consideration of project maintenance costs  with the underpinning of the utilitys asset management program is critical to ensuring maintenance  needs are fully represented when establishing funding adequacy. A 2002 GAO report estimated that 29  percent of water utilities deferred maintenance due to inadequate funding.", "1798": "Step 3: Account for the impacts new projects may have on overall utility system costs and  revenues In addition to affecting direct capital,  operations, and maintenance expenses,  selected project alternatives may also  affect overall cost and revenue structure.  To ensure revenue requirements  associated with the new projects are  correctly established, the following  potential impacts should be examined:   Changes in the cost of service to  different classes of customers;   Changes in the utilization and  expense of existing  infrastructure by the addition of  new infrastructure (e.g., bigger  new pipes that bring larger  volume flows to an existing treatment facility);   Changes in the type and utilization rates of personnel;   Changes in the need to provide emergency services; and   Changes in the resiliency of existing infrastructure and facilities (with potential implications for  emergency preparedness and insurance costs).", "1799": "As indicated above, new project(s) may also affect revenues available to the utility. The utility should  therefore examine if the project(s) will affect any of the assumptions used in its revenue projections.  Key areas for consideration are any change to the size of the customer base or to customer utilization  rates. For example, conservation pricing has the potential to decrease utilization rates as customers  conserve water, which may reduce revenues and potentially make them less predictable.17 Step 4: Develop a capital financing strategy Similarly, an  economic downturn can reduce the number of utility customers or their ability to pay. This decreased  rate-paying base can place substantial financial pressure on the utility. An effective capital financing strategy is critical  to the financial sustainability of the selected  project alternatives and the utility system as a  whole. A utility should seek a capital financing  strategy that keeps capital acquisition and  interest costs as low as possible and keeps the  repayment schedule (principal and interest)  consistent with revenue capacity (cash flow).  The mix of financing options used by the utility  and how debt is structured will affect financial  sustainability. There are two basic building  blocks of an effective capital financing strategy:  1) identifying and comparing the full range of  project financing options available, and 2)  managing capital commitments and debt  structure on an ongoing basis consistent with  utility revenue capacity and borrowing conditions.  ", "1800": "xamining the Options It is critically important to look at all funding options and carefully consider the differences in financing  costs they represent. Four basic options exist for capitalization of proposed project(s): rates and other  utility direct revenue sources, federal or state loan or subsidy programs, revenue bonds, and state  grants. The mix of capitalization approaches used can substantially affect borrowing costs and  repayment schedules. In general, utilities have two choices when funding new capital investmentsusing revenues to pay as  you go for new investments, or using long-term debt financing. Under a pay as you go approach,  capitalization through utility rates and other revenues does not carry debt financing costs, but it is  typically reserved for routine replacement of existing facilities, system extensions, and basic  improvements that can fit comfortably into annual utility revenue capacity. Major capital replacements", "1801": "and improvements, on the other hand, are typically financed using long-term debt. The use of long- term debt allows for capital costs to be distributed over a number of years and better matches customer  charges with the long-term benefits provided by the new projects. The primary options for addressing  major capital financing needs are federal and state loan programs and the private bond market. Each  will subject the utility to different interest, acquisition, and implementation costs", "1802": "EPAs Financing Alternatives Comparison Tool (FACT)", "1803": "PAs Financing Alternatives Comparison Tool (FACT) provides an illustration of how different  financing affects borrowing costs. 18 Table 3: FACT: Illustrative Example for Town of Clean Water FACT compares alternative financing strategies taking into account  interest rates, financing periods, amortization methods, and other financing factors. The table below  shows key input assumptions and results for an illustrative example for the Town of Clean Water. It  compares two financing approachesSRF Direct Loan and Revenue Bondto illustrate how different  capitalization approaches can substantially influence borrowing rates and the associated long-term  costs. Because the interest rate for the SRF option is substantially lower than the revenue bond  alternative (along with no reserve requirements), total net present value financial costs for the SRF  alternative are substantially lower for the utility. (Note that there may be other considerations in  weighing different financing approaches; for example SRF-funding is subject to Davis-Bacon wage  requirements while a revenue bond approach does not have these requirements.)

(In practice, the  comparison of rates will depend on factors such as a states or communitys bond rating.) Depending on ", "1804": "ommunity eligibility, government loan programs may also provide interest and principal forgiveness  options. These features can reduce debt financing costs substantially. These subsidies provide an  incentive for utilities to make sound investments (including investments in sustainability) that they  would not otherwise be able to make using commercial debt. SRF eligibility, review, and selection  processes are intended to ensure that utilities are making the best possible use of the subsidy.  Capital acquisition costs will be different for SRF funding and private capital. Government loan  programs will have loan application and ongoing reporting-related administrative costs. Private capital  acquisition costs typically include financial advisory services, bond counsel, underwriting fees, rating  agency fees, closing costs and fees, and bond insurance, and will have a mix of recurring costs including  those for reporting, accounting, and general administration. Further major project capitalization costs  include contributions to specified reserves (e.g., reserve account needs related to annual principal and  interest payments, for emergency repairs, and for replacements) or meeting coverage covenants  imposed by the indenture. There are no specific federal SRF requirements for reserves or coverage  covenants, although many state SRF programs require one or the other. Through coverage covenants,  state SRFs can require that, after operating and maintenance expenses are met, net annual revenues  must equal some increment above 100 percent (e.g., 120 percent) of the annual debt service payments  for principal and interest.  Although more favorable borrowing terms including incentives in some states for  green project investmentsare a principal  reason utilities seek SRF financing, not all  utilities are eligible. For those that are  eligible, there are other considerations to  take into account. For example, a utility  with many capital projects may choose to  seek SRF funding only for those most likely  to be approved or that would have the most  difficulty getting favorable terms in private  markets. SRF funding can also help  accelerate project implementation because  utilities with SRF loans can often obtain  accelerated consideration of environmental  and other permits. SRF funding, however,  covers only a small portion of the funding  needed for water and wastewater capital  needs and cannot be used for operations  and maintenance", "1805": "Structuring Capital Commitments and Debt Debt structure is the second critical aspect of a financing strategy. It is linked to prevailing borrowing  conditions and the phasing of capital project implementation. A utility, when structuring debt, should  consider prevailing and anticipated future bond market conditions (to the extent that revenue bonds are  an important element of the capital financing approach). Key variables a utility can manage, depending  on conditions, are the timing of borrowing, the amount of each increment of borrowing, and the mix of  interest and principal paid on an annual basis over the life of the repayment schedule. Maintaining  ongoing awareness of bond market conditions can provide refinancing opportunities throughout the life  of the project, particularly in cases where a utility has strategically deferred principal payments as a  result of financing during an unfavorable interest rate climate. Regardless of the public or private  financing option(s) selected, a utility can adjust project phasing, and therefore the associated annual  capital principal and interest cost requirements. Project phasing can smooth revenue requirements  over a several year period and help strike an effective balance with utility revenue capacity over the  debt financing period", "1806": "Step 5: Determine current revenue adequacy and develop future revenue strategy Steps 1 through 4 will provide the utility with a full accounting of the annualized costs and revenue  impacts of the new projects. This information can be overlaid on the utilitys current revenue  projections to determine revenue adequacy. In some cases, cost savings from new capital projects (e.g.,  from reduced maintenance costs or more efficient operations) and current revenue generation will be  sufficient to cover new debt payments. In other cases, major capital projects may shift cost structures in  a manner that requires increasing revenues, unless rates, in particular, have been previously structured  with future capital project financing needs in mind.", "1807": "Increasingly, many local governments, ranging from towns and cities to counties and regional partnerships, are taking more long-term, comprehensive approaches to economic development, with the goal of improving overall sustainability.

For air, EPAs Diesel Emissions Quantifier (http://cfpub. epa.gov/quantifier/view/welcome. cfm) can be used to quantify emission reductions from retrofitting, replacing and repowering older equipment as well as switching to cleaner fuels. To track success, a community might:  quantify the tons of emissions reduced  calculate the cost per ton of emissions reduced  document community satisfaction with pollution reduction, including noise  count the number of local projects using emission control devices/alternative fuels at active construction sites  document the number of local projects with clean diesel specifications in construction contracts. The Protecting Water Quality and Ensuring Future Supply chapter in this guide lists several measures of a healthy watershed (p. 43)  such as chemical and physical water quality  that also apply to green construction. In addition to those, other measures include the amount of:  construction projects that develop a pre- construction erosion and sedimentation reduction plan", "1901": "Measuring Success Some specific indicators of successful green procurement are:  amount of post-consumer recycled products used (e.g., office supplies, bags supplied by vendors, etc.)  number and volume of cleaning prod- ucts purchased from an approved green supplier  use of non-toxic carpets, paints and sealants  percentage of energy-efficient lighting, equipment and heating/air condition- ing systems  percentage of water-efficient fixtures  services rendered for green events and purchases from green food suppliers", "1902": "Green procurement is a sound strategy and a good initial step toward sustain- ability. It is:  easy to initiate and grow over time  relatively inexpensive and can often lead to net savings  a market stimulus for environmentally preferable products  a way to improve employee health and performance  a method to reduce existing and po- tential liabilities", "1903": "Goal Setting, Targets and Performance Measurement Strategies The old adage, If you cant measure it, you cant manage it holds true for sus- tainability planning. Once your plan be- gins implementation, it is important to gauge whether or not efficient and ef- fective progress is being made towards its goals. This can be achieved through benchmarking. Each section of this guide provides met- rics to emphasize that careful tracking is essential to the success of any program. Metrics and goals should not only be es- tablished for each element of your plan, but taking a holistic approach is recom- mended to link all governmental activities to the goal of sustainability. Once some overarching goals have been set, a series of measurement tools can be employed to establish baselines (e.g., a greenhouse gas inventory) and future assessments can ensure that targets are being met. From the baseline metric, all governmen- tal and community programs and sectors can and should be active participants in the sustainability process. Targets are more difficult to establish, so in some cases it is important to begin by tracking data. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, its annual State of Our Environment Report highlights the direction in which the citys indicators are heading. Burlington, Ver- mont started its planning process in 2000, setting a 10 percent greenhouse gas re- duction by 2005, and established goals based on this over-arching target. Its a good idea to record targets in a matrix for easy reference. Ultimately, goals, targets and indicators are important to creating accountability and public support.", "1904": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the Sustainable Design and Green Building Toolkit  for Local Governments (Toolkit) to assist local governments in identifying and removing barriers to sustainable  design and green building within their permitting process. This Toolkit addresses the codes/ordinances that would  affect the design, construction, renovation, and operation and maintenance of a building and its immediate site.  There are two sections to the Toolkit. The first section is an Assessment Tool and Resource Guide. The second  section is a guide to developing an Action Plan for implementing changes within a communitys permitting process.  ", "1905": "Assessment Tool  The goal of the Assessment Tool is to help the user better understand how a jurisdictions current codes/ordinances  and permitting process might allow or disallow sustainable design and green building practices. The Assessment  Tool is designed for local governments to review their permitting process and identify barriers to sustainable design.  The assessment will also help communities identify sustainable construction practices that are permissible but  nevertheless face resistance within the current permitting process. The Assessment Tool can be completed using the  print version or by using an Excel Spreadsheet. (insert link to Excel tool here) The Assessment Tool is divided into the following five categories, which were chosen because they have the  greatest potential to reduce a buildings environmental impact and remove the most commonly encountered  code/ordinance barriers to sustainable design:  Sustainable Sites and Responsible Land Use Development: addresses site development and minimizing the buildings impact on the surrounding environment.  Materials and Resource Conservation: addresses minimizing waste from the construction site and using green materials during construction.  Energy Conservation and Atmospheric Quality: addresses energy conservation, promoting the use of renewable and waste energy, and minimizing the buildings impact on air quality and the atmosphere.  Water Efficiency, Conservation, and Management: addresses the buildings water consumption and minimizing its impact on water quality.  Indoor Environmental Air Quality: addresses technologies or techniques that improve indoor air quality (IAQ).", "1906": "Resource Guide The Resource Guide is provided after each of the five categories and contains links to resources that will help  communities learn more about each category in the Assessment Tool. Additionally, the Resource Guide provides  users with information that can aid in making codes/ordinances more compatible or supportive of sustainable design  and green building. If green tools and techniques are not permitted or encouraged, this information can help local  governments implement changes to allow these techniques.  ", "1907": "The Action Plan can help communities implement necessary regulatory and permitting changes to allow for more  sustainable design. The framework presented for the Action Plan is just one of many pathways to implementing  changes in local permitting processes. The framework was based on collaborative decision making, change  management, and communication techniques and by evaluating best practices from other local communities. There  are six steps to the Action Plan: (1) establishing priorities, (2) conducting an internal situation assessment, (3)  conducting an external situation assessment, (4) designing the plan, (5) implementing the plan, and (6) conducting  an evaluation", "1908": "Who Should Use the Toolkit  The Toolkit was specifically developed with local governments in mind, but it can also be used by members of the  development community, local government green teams, and other building professionals.", "1909": "How the Toolkit Can Help Users can use the toolkit to conduct a guided assessment of the codes/ordinances associated with design and  construction. Once the assessment is complete, the user will have an understanding of where the permitting system  allows or incentivizes, or disallows and create barriers to, sustainable design and green building practices. The  Resource Guide provides links to documents, tools and techniques which can help the user identify ways to  overcome barriers. The Action Plan provided in Section 2 can help the user design an approach for implementing  the necessary regulatory and permitting changes to allow for more sustainable design. In doing so, the user can find  ways to encourage developers, contractors, and design professionals to plan for and use sustainable design tools and  techniques.  ", "1910": "Column 1: Overarching Questions These are high-level thematic questions that address the green initiatives and help provide direction on the  importance of the sustainable design and green building subcategory.  Columns 2 &3: Specific Questions and Potential Tools and Techniques The specific questions relate to the sustainable design and green building category and subcategory, and provide  greater detail on the overarching questions. The local government will assess its codes/ordinances based on these specific questions. Underneath the specific question examples of sustainable design and green building tools and  techniques that can be implemented to achieve the intent of each subcategory. This column can also be a guide to  identify which sections of the communitys codes/ordinances should be evaluated. The tools and techniques  provided in this column are not designed to be definitive or exhaustive, but rather are illustrative of common  approaches that local governments might use to achieve a particular sustainable design objective. Column 4: Assessment of Specific Questions Once the codes/ordinances are reviewed, Column 2 will ask for answers to the specific questions, which relate to the  tools and techniques. The user will determine if the sustainable design and green building approaches addressed by  the specific questions are:  Required by code/ordinance.  Incentives provided.  Expressly allowed.  Code/ordinance silent, but typically approved.  Code/ordinance silent, but not typically approved (or approved only under special circumstances).  Expressly prohibited. The more specific questions that fall under required by code/ordinance and incentives provided, the more one  would expect to see that sustainable design practices, tools, and techniques are being implemented in the  community. Conversely, if a greater number of specific questions fall under code/ordinance silent, but not typically  approved and expressly prohibited, this could indicate the barriers that hamper sustainable design  implementation in the community. A community that is seeking to expand green buildings within its jurisdiction  would want to have many of the answers to the specific questions fall under required by code/ordinance or  incentives provided. Please see Figure 1 for an example of the Assessment Tool. Column 5: Do Requirements Come from State or County? This column is designed to help the user designate if the specific question, tool, or technique is referenced in county  or state code. This designation is important as it helps identify areas within the permitting system that could be  changed more easily than others. For example, a municipality could have an easier time working on changes to the  permitting system that is under the countys purview than those changes that are under the states purview. By  Sustainable Design and Green Building Toolkit for Local Governments 5 completing this column, the user can easily track how many Yellow and Red actions are designated by local or  state regulations. Column 6: Code/Ordinance Reference As a user completes the assessment, it may be helpful to keep track of the questions, tools, and/or techniques and  where they originate in the code. This column allows the user to note where in the code the question, tool, and/or  technique is found for future reference. Often, to complete the full assessment, multiple individuals across  departments will need to review the assessment questions. The ability to provide a quick cross reference in the  assessment tool can aid in this type of review.", "1911": "How to Complete The Assessment Tool  and Resource Guide (insert link to Excel tool here) To complete the assessment, local officials are encouraged to do the following: 1. For each subcategory, read through the sustainable design objective, rationale, and overarching question. There may be a number of overarching questions for each subcategory. 2. Review the specific questions for the subcategory and identify segments of the local codes/ordinances that might address these questions. If a specific question is not applicable to the community skip the question and move on to the next one. 3. Each specific question leads to a series of potential tools and techniques that are associated with the specific question. These are some of the tools and techniques the local government may have used in its codes/ordinances. This list can also be a guide for which sections of the communitys codes/ordinances should be evaluated. Keep in mind that this list is not exhaustive. 4. Under the assessment of specific questions, assess the specific question and tools and techniques based on where local regulations lie on the flexibility/specificity spectrum and choose one of the following selections:  Required by code/ordinance.  Incentives provided.  Expressly allowed.  Code/ordinance silent, but typically allowed.  Code/ordinance silent, but not typically approved.  Expressly prohibited. Sustainable Design and Green Building Toolkit for Local Governments 7 5. If there are specific questions that are not included in the table, add them to the appropriate subcategory and provide the assessment. Likewise, feel free to add tools and techniques that the community uses to address the specific question. 6. While the assessment does not provide a score or grade, it does offer to the user an indication of potential areas for improvement. Green (required by code/ordinance or incentives provided) indicates that the community is doing well in encouraging sustainable design through its codes/ordinances and should continue. Yellow (expressly allowed or code/ordinance silent, but typically allowed) indicates that there is room for improvement within the existing permitting process. Red (code/ordinance silent, but not typically approved or expressly prohibited) indicates that the community may want to identify the cause of the barrier(s) and remove it from the process. Prior to beginning the assessment, all people who are responsible for completing the assessment should develop a common understanding of how Yellow may be interpreted and applied. It is important that the assessment reflects a consistent interpretation of those types of questions, tools and/or techniques that may inhibit sustainable design and green building. 7. Fill in the tally areas at the end of each subcategory and category to keep track of the number of green, yellow, and red answers that were given throughout the Assessment Tool. 8. Using the green, yellow, and red tally areas as a guide, review the Resource Guide for suggestions to overcome potential barriers to sustainable design. A community that wants to expand sustainable design practices in its jurisdiction will want to have the majority of the sustainable design subcategories fall under required by code/ordinance or incentives provided. The goal is to Get to Green! 9. Next, the user can designate if the specific question, tool, or technique for the yellow and red coded items, are referenced in the county or state code. This designation is important as it helps identify areas within the permitting system that could be changed more easily than others. For example, a municipality could have an easier time working on changes to the permitting system under the countys purview than those changes under the states purview. By completing this column, the user can easily track how many Yellow and Red actions are designated by local or state regulations. 10. As a user completes the assessment, it may be helpful to keep track of the questions, tools, and/or techniques and where they originate in the code. The user can note where in the code the questions, tools, and/or techniques are found for future reference. Often, to complete the full assessment, multiple individuals across departments will need to review the assessment questions. The ability to provide a quick cross reference in the assessment tool can aid in this type of cross-departmental review. 11. The final step is to develop an Action Plan to remove the identified potential barriers to sustainable design.", "1912": "Section 1: Sustainable Design Permitting  Assessment Tool and Resource Guide Before beginning the Assessment Tool, it may be helpful to answer the following questions to gain a better  understanding of the current local context and how these factors contribute to the outcome of the assessment and  next steps:  Have the most recent model codes/ordinances been adopted?

Rationale: Low-emitting materials release fewer Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and other  harmful chemicals into the air. These chemicals are found in higher concentrations  indoors and can cause a variety of different health problems, such as eye, nose, and throat  irritation; headaches; and kidney and liver damage.", "1963": "E.3 Moisture Control Objective: To prevent moisture from entering the building system through the exterior shell of the building; planned holes, such as windows, light switches, and electrical outlets; and unplanned gaps and leaks due to poor building design or construction. Rationale: Moisture entering the building is the primary reason for building deterioration. Controlling moisture can increase the buildings durability and longevity. Furthermore, moisture problems can lead to mold and other biological pollutants that can harm health. A variety of moisture control features, including improved control condensation and better roof, wall, and foundation drainage, can minimize these health risks.", "1964": "STEP 1: Establish Priorities The Toolkit helped identify areas where codes/ordinances could be changed to implement sustainable design  practices within a community. Now that these categories have been identified an Action Plan can be developed. The  first step in creating an Action Plan is to list and prioritize all of the potential areas for improvement. The questions  below can help identify which areas of a communitys codes/ordinances to tackle first.  Are the potential changes predominantly in one category (e.g., Energy Conservation and Atmospheric Quality) or are they randomly distributed (e.g., in all categories A-E)?  Are the potential changes mostly Red or Yellow, as indicated by the assessment of the specific questions? How many Reds versus Yellows are there?  How many changes can the local government potentially handle at a given time? To answer this question consider whether:  The local government has a large enough staff to develop and implement the changes.  The local government has the resources needed to develop and implement the changes.  The staff has the technical expertise required to make the changes within each of the five Categories.  It is more efficient to bundle the changes or implement them one-by-one over time.  How many potential changes are identified as under county or state jurisdiction? Codes adopted from the County may be easier to influence and change rather than codes adopted from state regulations. Once a preliminary prioritized list is developed, the next step is to assess the local governments internal capability  for moving the change(s) through the permitting process. The next two steps in developing the Action Plan deal with  managing the expectations of internal and external stakeholders.", "1965": "What departments and/or committees will be affected by code/ordinance changes?

Who would be driving that change?", "1970": "How often are permitting changes (related to sustainable design) proposed and supported internally?  Is this the first time this issue (or these issues) has been raised or have other efforts been attempted? What was the result?  If the permitting change was successfully implemented, what factors contributed to the internal support (e.g., low cost, relative ease of adoption, low impact on staff time and resources)?  If the permitting change was not successfully implemented, what factors contributed to the internal opposition (e.g. high cost, relative difficulty of adoption, high impact on staff time and resources)?", "1971": "To what extent can the proposed permitting changes be tried on a limited scale (e.g., first start with commercial development) before scaling up revised codes/ordinances for other development sectors (e.g., residential)?  Would small scale application hurt or help promote the proposed changes?", "1972": "From the departments, committees, or individuals affected by code/ordinance changes in Step 1, which of these has a strong interest from outside entities? The questions below can help answer this question:  Is there a high level of elected officials (e.g., city council) interest, engagement, and/or oversight?  Are there frequent conversations with non-profit groups, developers, builders, etc. around the affected department(s) and/or issue(s)?  Is the department or the specific issue being addressed a frequent recipient of praise or concern from external parties?", "1973": "How effective is the local governments ability to communicate with external parties:  Shares information in a timely manner?  Shares easily understandable informationthe right amount and the right format?  Knows how to make a compelling case for change?  Understands expectations from the various external stakeholder groups?  What additional data are needed to make decisions on potential regulatory changes from an external perspective?  Are these data needs similar to internal needs?  What level of external support does the local government have for the proposed regulatory changes?  From elected officials?  From the permittees or affected communitydevelopers, builders, owners, etc.?  From non-governmental and civic organizationse.g., local watershed groups, local historic preservation society, etc.?  From civic leaders and the general publicis this an issue that has been raised with the public before?  Is this an issue the public will actively care about?  Does the local government need active public support for this permitting change to occur?  To what extent are the changes consistent with the communitys elected officials policies, mission, or vision on sustainable design?  How often are regulatory changes (related to sustainable design) proposed and supported externally?  What factors contributed to the external support? These could include whether:  An elected official was a visible or vocal champion.  The permittee or affected community was a visible or vocal champion.  There was visible public support.  The change was low cost or cost neutral for the local government.  There was little organizational change needed.  The impacts on local government staff and resources were minimal.  Have other local governments of similar size, geographic location, etc., adopted similar regulatory changes?  Is it helpful to external parties to know that the proposed regulatory or permitting process changes have been implemented elsewhere?  Is it helpful to external parties to know that the community would be the first (e.g., in the area, state, region, etc.) to implement, change, or try something new?  What is the timing of the potential regulatory change?  Where is the communitys local government in terms of the political process:  Are the elected officials up for re-election or new to the local government?  Is the change being proposed during a busy or slow regulatory season?", "1974": "Is the change occurring during a period of high economic growth or slow economic growth?  Would a small scale application of proposed changes hurt or help promote the proposed changes within the local government?  Would a broader program (e.g., a sustainable design or green permitting program) hurt or help promote greater sustainable design in the community?", "1975": "Identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Issues To create an effective Action Plan, the local government needs to know the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities  for change. An effective Action Plan indicates that local government staff believes the changes can make a positive  difference, the local officials are supportive of change, the external stakeholdersfrom builders, to civic groups, to  the general publicare supportive of the changes, and the local community benefits. Potential issues need to be  identified up-front in the process. The local government should consider which sustainable design practices will  most likely be met with resistance in the community and by whom. For example, if the local government knows a  particular trade association has not typically been supportive of some sustainable design elements, a conversation  should be started with them early on in the process. It is difficult to anticipate and foresee every possible issue up- front in the process; however, taking the time to think through potential issues can be beneficial in managing and  addressing potential stakeholder expectations and concerns.  ", "1976": "Staff members who work in key related functions or departments within the local government and were identified in Step 1;", "1977": "Staff from additional departments, if they are needed, such as city architect, fire department, public works, public health, affordable housing, and legal; and", "1978": " Green teams already working in the community.", "1979": "Getting involvement from these key staff and community members will help streamline communication and pave  the way for internal support for the proposed permitting changes. Keeping in mind that some members of the team  may be active, while others may wish just to be kept informed, the responsibilities of the team could include the  following:   Interest in the topic and commitment to implementing changes in the permitting system that would foster greater sustainable design;", "1980": "Examination of opportunities and resources for sustainable design, which could be incorporated into permitting changes;  Development of goals, policies, and objectives of the potential changes; and  Presentation of draft proposals to appropriate bodies.", "1981": "1. Analyze the market and identify stakeholders potentially affected by proposed permitting changes This section5 should build on some of the preliminary analysis completed under Step 3. In Step 3, the user identified  segment(s) of the community that would be affected by the proposed permitting changes. This analysis is crucial and  will help ensure that the proposed changes move through the permitting system in an effective and efficient manner.  Also, the stakeholder involvement and communication plans must be tailored to the specific motivations and needs  of the various constituencies. As the user is putting together the list of potential stakeholders these questions should  be considered for each group or entity:   Who do the stakeholders represent (e.g., large developer, independent owner, management company) and their potential for involvement (e.g., substantive participant versus observer)?  What level of support might the local government expect from the person or entity?  How knowledgeable are they about sustainable design and the proposed permitting change(s)?  What market signals currently exist for sustainable design? Does the local government see these changing in the next 35 years? How will this impact the stakeholders?", "1982": "Finally, the local government should identify the types of current projects in the permitting approval pipeline and  what projects can be expected in the future. This should help determine the types of sectors that could be impacted  by the proposed permitting changes. The local government should make sure that the list is as comprehensive as  possible. The following list of potential sectors should be modified to suit the local governments needs:   Residential new construction  Residential remodeling  Commercial construction  Multi-family versus single-family  Civic buildings  Historic buildings  Utilities  Management companies  Realtors  Landscapers  Architects", "1983": ". Define the scope of the permitting change This section assists communities in detailing the nuts and bolts of the permitting changes they are trying to  implement. The market analysis from above and the following questions could help in developing the program  design:  Is the local government trying to pilot a small scale initiative or make wholesale changes?  Is the local government trying a phased approach over time, which may include performance-based measures that change over time?  Does the program change typical enforcement procedures?  Is this a required, voluntary, or incentives provided program?  Is the local government trying to implement a sustainable design/green design program?  What are the expected costs and revenues associated with the program?  Does the proposed change rely on third-party certification, inspection, etc.?  Might the jurisdiction be better advised to adopt, or possibly modify, some of the currently available green and sustainable building codes/ordinances and standards to reach their green goals?  Consider:  If adopting codes/ordinances that need to be enforced, these should be written as mandatory. Mandatory programs ensure that green practices will be implemented, the impact of the built environment on the natural environment will be reduced, and environmental goals will be met.  If a mandatory program is initiated, should it be applicable to public sector buildings only?  Are any of the available green building programs and standards suitable for application to the private sector on a mandatory basis?  Some examples of codes/ordinances and standards which are written in language suitable for mandatory adoption include: IgCC; ASHRAE 189.1; and, the ICC-700 National Green Building Standard.  Sustainable design programs and rating systems which are intended to be administered on a voluntary basis should not be adopted as mandatory.  Are there departmental practices (e.g., within the departments of health or public works), which are not addressed by the adopted code/ordinance or standard; and, if so, can these changes be used to suggest amendments to the codes/ordinances used by those other departments? The scope of the local governments program will greatly impact the stakeholder engagement and communication  plans that will need to be crafted.", "1984": "3. Develop a Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Plan To develop a stakeholder engagement and communication plan, the local government should start with each  stakeholder identified earlier in the process and ask them to provide a bulleted list of what drives them to engage in a  stakeholder process on sustainable design and green building and the related permitting changes. Then, based on that  ", "1985": "list, the local government should identify opportunities for engagement with that particular stakeholder for each  phase of the permitting process. These phases include:   Designing the permitting change(s) program,  During the permitting change process, and  Implementing the permitting change. Next, the local government should craft a draft communication plan with key points on how to engage key  stakeholders in the permitting process. This may be extremely helpful especially if new stakeholders exist, new  relationships have to be forged, or to make sure that everyone on the Sustainable Design and Green Building Team  has the same understanding of the permit change. The stakeholder engagement plan should also address local, state,  and other applicable laws and regulations regarding public access to information and meetings.  ", "1986": "Once these steps have been accomplished the local government has a foundation to determine the best ways to  engage and communicate with each specific stakeholder group and develop targeted engagement and  communication strategies.  The Sustainable Design and Green Building Team should then create a stakeholder engagement plan based on the  identified stakeholders and needs. For each stakeholder, the team should assess:  How to engage the stakeholder,  When to engage the stakeholder, and  Who is going to be responsible for communicating with the appropriate stakeholders. Based on collaboration and stakeholder engagement frameworks, it is generally easier to work with stakeholders including those who disagree with a positionif communication occurs early in the process, communication occurs  consistently, and the local government gives stakeholders the opportunity to share their opinions. Again, local and  state laws on public access and input should be at the forefront of discussions regarding stakeholder engagement.  The local governments stakeholder engagement plan should also include a communication strategy. This strategy  should have key talking points that can be used with each relevant stakeholder group; it should identify who is  responsible for communicating with the public, elected officials, press, etc. The communication strategy should  include appropriate means of communicationweb posting, public meetings, newspaper articles, presentations  posted to online video sites, etc. Table 1 provides some initial starting points for each stakeholder group.6 These  ", "1987": "generic short bullets on sustainable design and green building will need to be developed more broadly into talking  points and be tailored for the local governments specific permit process changes and the sustainable design and  green building concept or area the local government is trying to address. An integral piece of the communication  strategy should be education. For any stakeholder, including the public, who may not be familiar either with the  permitting process or sustainable design, the team will have to carefully determine what, how, when, and who  should provide the education, and the resources it will take to provide this education.", "1988": "Points to ConsiderPermitting Changes for Sustainable Design and Green Building7  Develop strong political backing, and gain support for funding, staffing, and other needed resources. Otherwise the regulatory and permitting changes will prove to be more difficult.  Consider exploring the pros and cons of the permitting system and the sustainable design goal to be achieved. Should the sustainable design components be mandatory, voluntary, or phased-in? Should there be incentives and/or penalties to obtain compliance?  Make use of the Resources Guide and other available information to understand other localities sustainable design programs and codes/ordinances for possible use as models.  Consider whether the Sustainable Design and Green Building team should take a working group approach and include elected officials, governmental staff members, developers and builders, and the public at large.  Work with the appropriate commissions, committees, or boards and use their meetings as a platform for workshops and public participation.  Conduct a sustainability workshop to illustrate how sustainable design and green building is connected to a host of related issues and help garner support from special interest groups.  Identify certain issues of great import (e.g., quality of life) to special interests and groups and make sure that the regulatory and permitting changes speak to their needs and concerns.  Select sustainable design and green building guidelines or standards that are appropriate for the organizations jurisdiction and that are regionally appropriate (e.g., climate, cultural, etc.).  Consult with legal counsel to ensure that proposed guidelines or standards do not conflict with other state or local regulations. In the case of an ordinance, be sure that it is legally defensible.  Consider whether the proposed changes call for the use of outside resourcese.g., third-party inspection of performance related specifications, certification, etc.", "1989": "Keep compliance thresholds realistic and try not to address them until the end of the development process.  Keep the triple-bottom lineenvironment, economy, and social equityin mind to ensure a sense of fairness for all parties.  If necessary, determine how the program or code/ordinance will be staffed and funded.  Make sure there are champions to shepherd the process and changes.", "1990": "STEP 5: Evaluate  Implementing permitting changes may be straightforward or complex in the local governments jurisdiction.  Hopefully, by implementing Steps 1-4, the local government should be able to reduce confusion, tension, or the  length of deliberations surrounding the permitting change. Regardless of the path, permitting changes are not a static  activity. Future innovations and improvements in sustainable design will continue to challenge the communitys  sustainable design codes/ordinances. Therefore, after one or two permitting changes are successfully through the  local government process, it is best to evaluate if the permitting change was effective in fostering the desired  sustainable design features in the community.  After the permitting change has been implemented for some period of time, or the program has become stable, it is  helpful to conduct an evaluation to determine if the change or program is working as planned and what corrections  may be necessary. The evaluation should determine how the change or program is working, whether it is working  the way the local government intended, whether it is being implemented effectively, and if the permitting change  process worked effectively and efficiently overall. This information can in turn be used to make program  improvements and generate lessons learned for the future. The following are the basic steps that could help in  evaluating the change/program:  1. Collect Data.  Conduct informal interviews with the stakeholder groups identified in Steps 2-3 via focus group meetings (how do they feel about the permitting change, do they understand it, do they support and why or why not?).  Review documents like permit applications (e.g., are sustainable design and green building projects being permitted quicker and with fewer variances; is there an increase in the number of permit applications using the tool/technique implemented in the permitting change?).  Review written and verbal feedback (e.g., have there been articles in the press, what is the public perception; are builders and constituents happier and have they voiced opinions in public hearings or other forums?).  Review physical evidence (e.g., are more sustainable design projects being built and are operated and maintained as permitted?). 2. Analyze the Data.8  What happened with the permitting change over time, including: stakeholders, activities, conditions, perceptions of the programs results?  How closely did the permitting change track with what the local government intended?  Were the improvements or goals of the permitting change achieved (pre-permit change conditions versus post-permit change conditions)?", "1991": "Is the observed change due to the permitting changes? Can other explanations be ruled out?  What was the value of the improvements? Are they apparent to others? Can they be quantified (this could include reduced permit transactions, reduced staff review time, improvement in customer satisfaction, increased revenue, and reduced environmental impacts of the permit change)?  What were the unexpected events, outcomes, and/or effects?  What do the findings imply for future modifications and permit changes?  What were the lessons learned and how do they impact either broadening the permit changes or their transferability within the community (scale up of a pilot program) or beyond?", "1992": "3. Tell the Story To tell the story, the local government should think about the reporting needs of the local government and what  information could help meet those needs. The local government should also think about the various stakeholders  identified in Steps 2 and 3: what was important to them, what types of questions did they ask, and what do they want  to know and when? The local government should also consider what reporting format would be best to tell the story.  Typically, the findings from an evaluation are documented in a report but this may or may not be the appropriate  communication tool for the audience the local government is trying to reach. For example, if the user knows that  department heads internal to the local government were very interested in the permitting change, they may want to  brief them periodically and prepare an evaluation presentation that includes the questions the user is trying to answer  regarding the permitting change, a summary of the data collected, a review of the data analysis, and how the user  plans to use the results to change or modify the current program or future permitting changes.  If the public is very interested in the permitting change, the local government may want to conduct a public meeting  or forum with a presentation and have a prepared paper to distribute. Regardless of how the organization presents  the evaluation study, decisions will have to be made on how to act on the recommendations. Revising the internal  and external situation assessment in Steps 2 and 3 may provide some guidance on how best to proceed.", "1993": "Whats inside this toolkit Sustainability is a journey, and ICLEIs toolkit provides the guidelines and resources for any local gov- ernment to develop a sustainability plan and begin this journey. The toolkit is intended for local govern- ments large and small, including cities, towns, and counties. The primary audience is local government  staff responsible for developing and implementing a sustainability plantypically sustainability coor- dinators or sustainability directors. Other local government staff involved in the planning process will  also find the toolkit useful to understand their role in the bigger picture. Community members or elected  officials interested in contributing to the development of a local governments sustainability plan are also  encouraged to use the toolkit as a resource. Recognizing that local governments around the United States are vastly different, this toolkit presents a straightforward yet flexible process for developing a sustainability plan. It can be used by any local  government regardless of its structure, geography, size, and available resources. The foundation of the toolkit is the Five Milestones for Sustainability process, which outlines the major steps a local govern- ment should follow to improve its sustainability. The Five Milestones for Sustainability are an evolution of ICLEIs Five Milestones for Climate Mitigation and includes the following five major steps:   Milestone One: Conduct a sustainability assessment   Milestone Two: Establish sustainability goals   Milestone Three: Develop a local sustainability plan   Milestone Four: Implement policies and measures   Milestone Five: Evaluate progress and report results Readers will find guidance on both how to structure their planning process and what types of strategies  and measures to include in their sustainability plan. This toolkit places particular emphasis on the ap- proach to the planning process, because having a high-quality plan isnt enough. A well-executed planning  process is essential because it builds broad support from local stakeholders which leads to a smoother  implementation process. Local governments are encouraged to use the framework of the Five Milestones for Sustainability as a starting point to understand the key steps involved in developing a sustainability plan. The toolkit can be  used by local governments at the very early stages of the planning process or by local governments that  already have a plan and are preparing to update it. To assist local governments, the toolkit provides:   Step-by-step guidelines for how to achieve each milestone   Tips on what to include in a sustainability plan   Best-practice examples   Checklists and templates   Guidelines for organizing a team of experts to develop the plan", "1994": "According to the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, sustainability means meet- ing the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own  needs. The three, interrelated pillars of sustainable development include the environment, social equity,  and economic development (see Figure 1). To act sustainably is to balance the aims of these pillars with the need to use  resources more efficiently.", "1995": "Developing a sustainability plan may seem like a daunting task. Yet local governments will find that the  benefits of having an overarching planone that ties together all of their sustainability policies and pro- gramswill far outweigh the costs of staff time required to develop the plan. A sustainability plan is not  only a useful tool for local governments just starting out on their sustainability journey, but also for more green jurisdictions that want to package all of their various measures under a single umbrella. Many local governments have already implemented a number of environmental and energy saving programs,  often on a one-off basis. However, they often lack a single framework for measuring the impact of their The Three Pillars of Sustainability Environmental Economic Social SUSTAINABLE Figure 16 programs. A sustainability plan provides a means of bringing everything together under a set  of goals and metrics and provides a vision for the future development of the jurisdiction. Creating a framework for long-term sustainability is the end goal of developing a sustainabil- ity plan, but the planning process itself has a number of benefits for a community as well. The planning process enables a jurisdiction to:   Raise awareness within the local community on key challenges and opportunities affecting long-term development and quality of life.    Develop common goals and build support within the local government and the   community for the desired future development of the jurisdiction.   Increase transparency through a long-term dialogue using public outreach, and demonstrate accountability by openly monitoring and evaluating progress.   Encourage interdepartmental cooperation by asking tough questions and addressing complex issues. A sustainability plan provides a common framework for action that has the potential to:   Use resources more efficiently by identifying opportunities to conserve energy and save money through smart investments with identifiable payback periods.   Promote smart economic development by creating jobs, increasing the tax base,   encouraging development, and increasing the jurisdictions competitiveness.   Improve the environment by monitoring and improving local air quality, reducing green- house gas emissions, cleaning up waterways, reducing auto dependency by increasing  transportation options, decreasing waste, and reducing urban sprawl.   Create a more equitable society by targeting economic and environmental improvements to communities most in need, and by ensuring that all residents have  access to high-quality health care, education, and arts and cultural amenities.   Lay the groundwork for major investments that can have a dramatic impact on the   overall sustainability of the jurisdiction. As this toolkit will address in the chapter, Scope of a Sustainability Plan, sustainability is a  broad topic that has the potential to address all of these goals. However, every locality is different and local governments need to define their top concerns and priorities.", "1996": "2. SCOPE OF A SUSTAINABILITY PLAN", "1997": "2.1 Sustainability Plans vs. Climate Action Plans Local governments considering their approach to responding to climate change and addressing sustainability  issues have several options. The most common approaches are either a sustainability plan or a climate action  plan. Although the two are similar, they differ in scope and overall approach to framing the issues. A sustainabil- ity plan can be considered a climate action plan with a broader, more holistic view on community sustainability. Climate Action Plans A climate action plan focuses primarily on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions  resulting from both the local governments operations and from the community as a whole. It typically  includes an analysis of the opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from energy  use in transportation, solid waste disposal, buildings, lighting, and waste water treatment and water  delivery. Some local governments also include environmental opportunities beyond reducing energy  consumptionsuch as the development of renewable energy resources, the conservation of natural  resources, forestry (urban and beyond), agriculture, and green jobs. A climate action plan often ad- dresses the co-benefits of its initiatives, such as improving air quality and public health or reducing  stormwater runoff. However, a climate action plan does not explicate these other issues as thoroughly as a sustainability plan. For more information on climate action planning, visit ICLEIs website: www.icleiusa.org/action-center/planning. Sustainability Plans A sustainability plan typically includes an overarching goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in addition  to addressing a set of environmental, economic, and social equity goals. It takes into account the interrelated  issues of climate change, population change, land use, infrastructure, natural resource management, quality  of life, public health, and economic development. Both short-term and long-term measures that can quantifi- ably impact these issues should be included in a sustainability plan. A sustainability plan should not only in- clude a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate other environmental issues, but also goals to  equitably improve land use practices and infrastructure such as by increasing open space, reducing storm-9 water runoff, or providing more affordable housing options. The plan should recognize and highlight how its measures can help achieve multiple sustainability goals. Social equity should be a crosscutting theme in the  plan and each measure should be designed so that the benefits will be distributed across the community.", "1998": "Choosing a Plan Local governments should identify the issues they want to address in their plan and then determine wheth- er a climate action plan or a sustainability plan is appropriate. For either type of plan, local governments should start by performing a greenhouse gas emissions inventory for government operations and the com- munity. Some local governments may elect to begin their sustainability efforts with a focused climate action  plan, and then in the future, expand its scope to become a sustainability plan. Whereas other local govern- ments might prefer to look at all of the sustainability issues holistically and develop a more comprehensive  sustainability plan from the beginning. Local governments may also choose the type of plan that is appro- priate for their community based on the communitys resources and priorities. In some jurisdictions taking local action against climate change might be the primary driver for the plan, however in others, concerns  such as poor air quality or a polluted wetlands might be more pressing concerns that could be addressed  within the broader context of a sustainability plan.

Like a sustainability plan, these plans provide a vi- sion for the long-term development of the municipality and include land use, infrastructure, and natural  resources plans. However, these plans historically have focused on controlling and guiding development, not addressing energy use, climate change, or natural resource issues. Nor have they typically included  policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissionsa central component to a sustainability plan. Recog- nizing that local governments have limited resources to develop various required and voluntary plans, this toolkit can be used by local governments that want to develop a standalone sustainability plan or  integrate sustainability into their comprehensive plan.", "2000": "Local governments should ensure that the scope  of their sustainability plan addresses the most  pressing challenges and includes measures that  are implementable and achievable.  The plan also needs to be accessible and easily  understandable to the general public. To do this,  it must clearly explain the key sustainably chal- lenges, high-level sustainability goals, and the  rationale for each measure. A sustainability plan  should include:  Facts, charts, and figures from the sustain- ability assessment, including a greenhouse gas  emissions inventory of government operations  and the community, to illustrate key challenges  to be addressed in the plan   Goals to set a vision and framework for the plan, including an emissions reduction target for the short, medium, and long-term (e.g., a target within the next five to 10 years and a target to reduce emissions 80 percent by 2050)   Measures with clear implementation plans covering timing, funding, and responsibilities   A clear explanation of how the measures will achieve the goals and address the challenges, and an estimation of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential of each measure   Short-term measures with targets within the next five years   Long-term measures with targets over the next 10 to 20 years   A timeline and framework for monitoring implementation process and updating the plan Refer to the sample outline for a sustainability plan (in your toolkit folder) for more details on what to include in the plan.", "2001": "The scope of a sustainability plan will vary by jurisdiction based on local challenges and needs.

The sustainability coordinator should organize a team of contributing departmental staff and external experts. Before launching into the planning process, the sustainability coordinator should develop a workplan and outreach strategy to guide the planning process. As described in the Five Milestones for Sustainability process guidelines, public outreach should be incorporated into each milestone, as shown  in Figure 2.", "2003": "Public Outreach Two of the central principles of sustainability planning are transparency and inclusiveness. To adhere to  these principles while developing a plan, local governments should include the public throughout the  planning process. Public outreach is not considered a milestone itself, since it is part of each step in the  Five Milestone process.", "2004": "Milestone One: Conduct a Sustainability Assessment Assess the sustainability of the jurisdiction using a set of metrics to understand the key challenges. To start the planning process, a local government needs to first research and assess environmental,  economic, and social equity challenges within the jurisdictionand the current programs in place to address these issues. This can either take the form of a quick-action assessment or a comprehensive  assessment. In either case, a local government needs to develop a greenhouse gas emissions inventory  for both government operations and the community, using ICLEIs tools and protocols. The inventory will  be one of the primary sources of information to guide the planning process and identify opportunities to  reduce emissions. A quick-action assessment involves developing a greenhouse gas emissions inventory for government  and community emissions using, along with a high-level quantitative or a detailed qualitative assessment  of the sustainability challenges. A comprehensive assessment involves a more extensive data analysis. It  takes into account all (or most) of the data categories in the Sustainability Assessment Checklist (in your toolkit folder), which include the quick-action assessment data categories along with a more rigorous  analysis of infrastructure capacity, land use patterns, and natural resources issues. Challenges ad- dressed in the sustainability assessment could include population loss, greenhouse gas emissions, high  housing costs, poor air quality, rising energy costs, limited energy supply, flooding risks, endangered  natural resources, or aging infrastructure. Local governments should start by casting a wide net and looking at a broad set of issues using the  Sustainability Assessment Checklist, in order to define the high-priority topics they would like to address  in the sustainability plan. The sustainability assessment should not only include an analysis of hard num- bers, but should also take into account public concerns and priorities. This baseline assessment will help  define the scope of the plan and will be used as a platform for action to communicate to the public the  key challenges facing the jurisdiction. It will also help to highlight successful existing programs that can be expanded and will identify gaps where opportunities for improvement exist.", "2005": "Milestone Two: Establish Sustainability Goals Establish sustainability goals to define the overarching objectives of the sustainability plan. In parallel to researching the challenges in Milestone One, a local government needs to develop a set of  goals that will set the vision and framework for the plan. The goals are used to define the scope of the  plan and to provide a framework for public outreach. They should include a greenhouse gas emissions  reduction target along with other goals, such as those related to natural resources, transportation, land  use, energy, water, waste, air quality, economic development, education, health, and housing.", "2006": "Milestone Three: Develop a Local Sustainability Plan Develop a set of measures that enable the jurisdiction to achieve the sustainability goals. The next step in the process is to brainstorm all possible strategies for achieving the goals. Strategies  are the high-level approaches to address the key challenges. Within one strategy, such as promote  green building, there can be a number of measures that are required to implement the strategy. After  identifying the strategies, local governments should then create and analyze the potential measures, such as specific policies, projects, or other actions. Measures should have a clear implementation plan, including designation of a responsible department/ party, funding source, timeline, next steps, short- and long-term milestones, and indicators for measur- ing progress. In addition, the plan should illustrate how each measure helps to achieve the goals of the  plan. To allow the local government to track progress during Milestone Five, baseline data for each indi- cator also needs to be gathered. In parallel to developing the plan, local governments need to engage in a significant level of public  outreach to provide a diversity of constituents the opportunity to contribute ideas for the plan. Outreach  can include town hallstyle meetings, focus groups, and a website set up for public comment. Public  outreach can last anywhere from a couple of months to a year and is an essential step in the process to  ensure the public supports the plan. To complete Milestone Three, local governments need to publicly release and/or adopt their sustain- ability plan, which should include an implementation plan for each measure. Local governments should  estimate the costs for the measures in the plan and prioritize the measures based on impact, budgetary constraints, and implementation timeline.", "2007": "Milestone Four: Implement Policies and Measures Implement the sustainability plan and track implementation progress. After the local government releases its sustainability plan, implementation should begin immediately. The  various local government departments should be responsible for implementing the plan and the sustain- ability coordinator should coordinate and monitor the implementation progress. It is difficult to work on  all measures at once, so local governments need to be strategic in how they utilize their staff resources to implement the plan. It is highly recommended that a local government prioritize the measures identi- fied in the sustainability plan and go after the quick wins first, while at the same time begin planning for  larger-scale measures that have a longer implementation timeframe. Implementing the quick wins first  will serve to maintain the momentum generated through the planning process and will lay the ground- work for implementing the longer-term measures.", "2008": "Milestone Five: Evaluate Progress and Report Results Report on the implementation progress of the sustainability plan. Local governments should publish an annual progress report on the implementation status of the mea- sures in the sustainability plan. The progress report should include a description of the actions taken and  the next steps in the upcoming year and beyond. In addition to the progress report, local governments  should track their performance using a set of sustainability indicators. Local governments should up- date their greenhouse gas emissions inventory on a regular basis, at a minimum once every five years,  although ICLEI recommends updating it more frequently. Many local governments opt to update their  inventory annually. The Five Milestone process restarts when it is time to update the plan. ICLEI recommends that local govern- ments define a periodic timeframe for updating the plan (e.g., once every five years), to ensure that the plan meets the changing needs and conditions of the jurisdiction, and is an active part of the political agenda.", "2009": "Figure 3 illustrates the stakeholders involved in developing a sustainability plan: the chief elected official, interdepartmental team, sustainability advisory board, subject matter experts, key stakeholder groups, and the public at large.

Developing a sustainability plan is a major undertaking with many moving pieces that requires someone to keep the effort on target in terms of its vision, scope,  and overall timeline. Depending on available staff resources and the size of the local government, the sustainability coordinator could be focused on the plan full-time or part-time. The coordinator could either  be an existing staff member who is tasked with coordinating the plan, or a new hire. At a minimum, ICLEI  recommends that local governments designate a sustainability coordinator who is available at least part- time to work on the plan, although a full-time staff person is preferable. Given the broad scope and the number of stakeholders involved in the planning process, the sustainability  coordinator plays a critical role in bringing everyone together, sharing ideas, and facilitating the process.  The coordinator should participate in all of the sustainability advisory board, working group, interdepart- mental, and outreach meetings, and keep them focused on the desired outcomes. Although the interde- partmental team is responsible for developing and vetting potential measures, the sustainability coordinator  needs to be well versed in all of the issues to guide and often push the planning process forward.", "2011": "Interdepartmental Team Fostering an environment for interdepartmental collaboration is one of the key components of a suc- cessful planning process. The planning process will help to break down departmental silos and encour- age local government staff members to collaborate on issues that cross multiple departmental boundar- ies. Local governments will find that the planning process will spark a new way of thinking and will help  to build new relationships within the government to create an atmosphere for innovative problem solving. Developing a sustainability plan requires participation and commitment from a variety of governmental departments. The chief elected official should communicate that this effort is a top priority to ensure the  relevant departments commit the appropriate staff resources to the plan. Departmental directors should assign a departmental liaison to participate in the interdepartmental team and ensure that the team mem- ber can devote sufficient time to the plan. The interdepartmental team is responsible for researching best practices, gathering data for the sustain- ability assessment, and vetting potential measures. Typical departments involved in the team include  public works, planning, transportation, buildings, environmental protection, parks, sanitation, housing,  economic development, public health, and education.", "2012": "Sustainability Advisory Board A major interdisciplinary effort like a sustainability plan requires guidance and advice from a diverse external group of experts on a sustainability advisory board. In their capacity of contributing ideas and  guidance, board members should act as representatives of their various constituency groups in addition  to being demographically diverse. The board should be comprised of a variety of stakeholder groups  focused on big-picture issues rather than specific interests, including environmental and community  advocates, business leaders, real estate developers, planners, philanthropists, academics, and labor  leaders who can act as representatives for their constituency groups. In addition, local governments may  also want to include representatives from regional planning, state, or county offices on the sustainability  advisory board. Forming the board requires striking a balance between being inclusive while ensuring that the board stays small enough to be manageable and productive.20 In order to receive constructive input from the sustainability advisory board on specific strategies and  measures, separate working groups should be formed to allow for in-depth analysis. The working group  meetings should focus on the details of the plan. The full board meetings should share information from  the working group meetings to ensure coordination between working groups and to ensure all ideas are  aligned with the big picture.  Interdepartmental team members should be included in these working group meetings and should use  these meetings as a venue for floating policy ideas and receiving feedback. Sustainability advisory board  members should attend working group meetings themselves, but since they will tend to be very busy  people, they should be allowed to send a representative from their organization with expertise in the is- sues. It works best when there is one representative who attends all the meetings so they stay abreast  with the issues.  After the plan is released, the role of the sustainability advisory board can shift to advising on the imple- mentation of the plan and/or monitoring implementation of the plan. Some local governments may  choose to sun-shine their boards after the plan is developed, whereas others may continue to keep the  board involved in the plan development", "2013": "Elected Officials No matter the governance structure of a local government, it is essential to have buy-in to develop the  sustainability plan from at least one elected official, preferably the chief elected official. The chief elected  official will play a critical role in communicating key messages to the public, ensuring the commitment  and participation of government departments, and in providing a public face to the plan to ensure  governmental accountability in implementing the plan. Although the chief elected official may not initially lead the charge to develop a sustainability plan, the  sustainability coordinator and departmental directors will need to ensure that the chief elected official  supports the planning process and understands how the plan fits into the overarching goals of the community.", "2014": "Key Stakeholder Groups Although the sustainability advisory board is designed to be inclusive and to represent a diversity of  constituency groups, it is often necessary to reach out to additional stakeholder groups directly to  ensure that they have the opportunity to contribute their ideas and have their voices heard. This will  allow for greater participation and buy-in and ensure that groups representing specific interests are able  to contribute to the process. The meetings should not only include environmental advocacy groups but  also other active interest groups, even if they do not typically work on sustainability issues. These meet- ings can be held with individual groups or with a number of groups who are interested in similar issues.  Their feedback and insight should be documented and disseminated to the advisory board and interde- partmental team and their ideas should be incorporated into the plan.", "2015": "General Public To create a fully inclusive and  transparent process, the public- at-large should have the opportu- nity to provide input into the plan  through a variety of outlets. These  can include public meetings,  smaller meetings with key stake- holder groups, a website for pub- lic comment, and online forums.  In addition to asking the public for  their input, local governments can  also use public meetings as an  opportunity to educate the public  about the challenges the locality  faces, sustainability issues, and  climate change. Public meet- ings can be a great way to start  a dialogue about how individuals  can make a difference by making  small changes and more informed  decisions; meetings can also pre- pare them for any major transfor- mative measures that may come  out of the plan.", "2016": "External Experts External experts, such as local universities, nonprofits, or consultants, may be tapped to help with  specific sections of the plan or to provide overall support or advice. Local governments are encouraged  to seek academic partners to aid in the development of their sustainability plan, particularly if it comple- ments the institutions existing research programs. Many local governments have also been able to solicit  pro-bono assistance from local research institutions or consultants. Some local governments may elect  to hire a consultant to help develop the plan or to provide a rigorous analysis to support certain aspects  of the plan. Regardless of the level of external support a local government receives, it is necessary for the  government to take full ownership of the planning process and the measures in the plan. All measures in  the plan should be vetted internally to ensure that they are implementable and supported by the relevant  departments. ", "2017": "Milestone Purpose: To start the planning process with a baseline understanding of the major sustain- ability challenges in a jurisdiction in order to identify the key issues to be addressed in the plan. Milestone Description: The sustainability assessment involves inventorying the existing measures that  have been implemented, defining a set of sustainability indicators, gathering data for those indicators, and  developing a sustainability assessment report. This process will help to identify the major sustainability challenges in the jurisdiction and to understand the measures that have already been taken to address these challenges. The assessment includes developing a greenhouse gas emissions inventory, along with  analyzing data for key indicators related to infrastructure, land use, water and air quality, waste, economics, natural resources, and public health. This assessment should be summarized in a sustainability assessment report, which will define the key issues and challenges to be addressed in the sustainability plan.", "2018": "1.

Gather and analyze data for the sustainability assessment to define key issues.   Define the sectors to be included in the sustainability assessment and identify indicators and data needs using the Sustainability Assessment Checklist.   Indicators should be clear, relevant, compelling, and measurable, and should address the overall sustainability of the jurisdiction.   Determine if a quick-action assessment or a comprehensive assessment is needed (Smaller local governments will typically want to perform a quick action assess- ment, and larger local governments should perform a comprehensive assessment).   Present the sustainability assessment to the sustainability advisory board to ensure everyone is working with the same baseline information and to make sure  the board members agree on the key challenges facing the jurisdiction.   Task each department with research to identify the key challenges: Each depart- ment should assess the current state, trends, and business-as-usual scenarios  within its domain, and research best practices for moving toward greater sustain- ability. Assess population change, infrastructure capacity, land use and transporta- tion patterns, greenhouse gas emissions, housing availability and prices, pollution  sources as outlined in the Sustainability Assessment Checklist.   The greenhouse gas emissions baseline can be used as the overarching indicator for the sustainability assessment.   When possible, use data from existing plans or reports to develop the sustain- ability assessment. Many departments may already have this data readily available  as they may already be working on a number of the issues to be addressed in the  plan. If the data isnt available, prioritize which information will be the most useful and perform a quick-action assessment. If you elect to do a quick-action assess- ment, keep in mind that you will need to gather data later in the process to estab- lish metrics and baselines for the measures in the plan.   Use your sustainability advisory board wisely, and task board members with  research to contribute to the sustainability assessment.   Cast a wide net when gathering data for the sustainability assessment, but balance  time constraints and staff resources to focus the assessment on top priority infor- mation needed for the sustainability plan, such as the greenhouse gas inventory.", "2023": "5. Solicit ideas from the public and key stakeholders on the goals, guiding principles, and key   challenges to be addressed in the plan.   Hold small group meetings with stakeholder groups to get their perspective on the key issues affecting the sustainability of the jurisdiction. For instance, set up a group meeting with the directors of transportation advocacy organizations to hear their ideas and to begin the dialogue with a group of representatives to encourage them to speak together.

Solicit input from the sustainability advisory board on the goals and  have the board members publicly  endorse the goals, to demonstrate  broad support early in the process.36   Review the goals by the sustainability advisory board and incorporate their feedback.   Develop two emissions reductions targets: an emissions reduction tar- get for the community as a whole, and one for government operations  only. These targets can be the same, but often local governments elect  to set a more aggressive target for government operations to position  the government as a leader.

Update the draft outreach plan created in the pre-planning phase with the following information: o Stakeholders to involve in the outreach process. o Schedule and location of the outreach meetings in a variety of locations throughout  the jurisdiction.   Concurrent with the public meetings, the sustainability coordinator and staff should continue to meet with advocacy organizations and stakeholders to receive feedback and test ideas. These meetings can be conducted as one-on-one meetings or with small groups.   Include the interdepartmental team and departmental directors in the outreach meetings, so they can hear direct feedback from the public and can incorporate public opinion in to their  analysis of potential strategies. The team can also address questions raised by the public when  a proposed strategy is not viable.
